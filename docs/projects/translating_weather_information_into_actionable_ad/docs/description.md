IMARIKA by Strathmore University’s iLabAfrica is building low-cost automatic weather station networks to provide access to accurate, local weather information in rural Kenya. This granular data allows advisory services for small-holder farmers to shift from using generic information to location-specific guidance, delivered through farmer organizations and digital platforms. IMARIKA also works on translating weather data into actionable recommendations, addressing farmers’ difficulty in interpreting weather information.

IMARIKA by Strathmore University’s iLabAfrica is also the winner of the "Innovate Africa Challenge on Climate Action",  - chosen for its potential to advance climate adaptation for small-holder farmer communities. Together with Smart Africa, FAIR Forward had supported seven startups through intensive technical and business support to develop their AI businesses focused on mitigating and adapting to climate change in four countries through the Innovate Africa Challenge format in its first iteration focusing on AI for Climate Action.
