The model developed as part of this project is an incident prediction system designed to operate as an early warning system for Ecuador's electrical infrastructure. Specifically, it uses integrated satellite images and meteorological information from INAMHI, such as climatic variables like storms or strong winds, to anticipate possible failures or incidents in the electrical infrastructure associated with these weather conditions. This prediction system is a powerful tool for critical infrastructure planning and risk reduction, and is intended for future integration into the risk management systems of electricity sector companies. However, its main limitation is the availability of data from official sources, as it requires satellite images and meteorological information from INAMHI to operate.
