This project has created a web platform that centralises and visualises energy consumption and production data in Ecuador. It integrates historical and real-time information from official sources such as CENACE, CELEC and INAMHI. The platform presents this information in the form of graphs and heat maps. Additionally, a second application uses satellite images to predict incidents in the electrical system associated with meteorological variables. The project aimed to address a lack of data by making energy information more accessible and representative, enabling proactive management in the face of climatic events. Alongside the platform, the project involved measuring device consumption to improve energy efficiency, and the resulting dataset is publicly available to researchers and students.
