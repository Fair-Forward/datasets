Smallholder farmers are crucial contributors to global food production, and in India often suffer most from poverty and malnutrition. These farmers face challenges such as limited access to modern agriculture, unpredictable weather, and resource constraints. To tackle this issue, Digital Green collected data via surveys, offering insights into farming practices, environmental conditions, and crop yields.

The possibilities include creating a machine learning solution to predict the crop yield per acre of rice or wheat crops in India. Our goal is to empower these farmers and break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.

This use case also included the development of a business model and funding model for open source AI as a stepping stone towards financially viable operations. It was facilitated by Villgro Africa's and FAIR Forward's  six-month mentorship programme on "Creating sustainable business and funding models with open source AI".
