Miti360 is an integrated, machine-learning ready dataset for individual-tree and stand-level reforestation monitoring that fuses high-resolution drone orthophotos, terrestrial stereo and single images, precise ground measurements (tree height, crown diameter, basal diameter and GPS locations), species labels, and multi-year weather time series for nearby stations. The collection is designed to support detection, segmentation, species classification, and biophysical parameter estimation (e.g., crown diameter, height, biomass proxies), and to enable linking short-term growth dynamics to weather. Data are provided in standard GIS and ML formats (GeoTIFF, JPEG, JSON, SHP, time-series API) for immediate integration into research and operational pipelines.
