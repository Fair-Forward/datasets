Imarika is a conversational chatbot offering digital climate advisory services in English and Swahili that will support smallholder farmers to adapt to changing weather patterns. The project aims to address the vulnerability of farmers to weather unpredictability due to the lack of accessible, reliable, and localized weather forecasts. Access to weather information is highly variable across sub-Saharan Africa and is usually limited to low-accuracy national or regional forecasts broadcast on radio and/or TV. The project specifically hopes to serve smallholder farmers who often have limited access to localized climate advisory services due to barriers such as slow technology penetration or digital illiteracy. 

This was part of a Mozilla innovation challenge supporting people and projects across East Africa who leverage Common Voice’s open-source voice data set to unlock social and economic opportunities. These grants help to advance the use of open-source voice data for products that support community participation and engagement.
