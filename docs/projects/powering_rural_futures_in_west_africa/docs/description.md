The project provides two openly accessible datasets that were developed through a complete, reproducible data pipeline combining machine learning with stochastic energy-system simulation. The first dataset contains predicted appliance ownership and household counts for all 1,209 administrative level 2 regions (adm2) across Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Niger, derived from satellite-based features and socio-economic indicators using models trained on more than 3,500 household surveys. The second dataset consists of high-resolution synthetic electricity demand profiles generated with the RAMP tool, offering minute-by-minute load curves for an entire year for each adm2 region. Together, these datasets provide a unique, representative, and scalable foundation for understanding residential electricity demand in regions where measured data is scarce or entirely unavailable.
