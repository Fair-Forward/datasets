The two datasets provide complementary, high-resolution information on household electricity demand across 1,209 administrative level 2 regions in West Africa. The ML dataset contains per-region estimates of household numbers, appliance ownership across 17 categories, and cluster identifiers reflecting typical appliance-use behaviour. The demand dataset includes both full-year, minute-resolution load profiles (527,040 time steps per region) and aggregated daily curves, along with summary statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, and total annual demand. Files are structured as standardized CSVs, organized by country, and kept in manageable sizes. Users can easily import the data into analytical workflows for energy planning, electrification modelling, scenario design, or spatial analysis. Because the pipeline is fully open source, users may also retrain models, adjust appliance usage parameters, or generate new simulations tailored to local contexts. Together, the datasets offer granular, scalable, and customizable inputs for researchers, utilities, developers, and policymakers working on electricity access and energy-system planning.
