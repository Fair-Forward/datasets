The geodatabase provides detailed plot-level and tree-level field data from Colombian Caribbean mangroves, including measurements such as DBH, height, species, above-ground biomass (AGB), and above-ground carbon (AGC). Users can directly integrate the Ground_truth dataset with other similar field datasets to train and validate machine learning models for accurate estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon stocks.
The satellite dataset supports spatially explicit analysis of forest structure, carbon dynamics, and environmental factors influencing mangrove ecosystems. Combined with additional datasets, it can help improve model robustness, enable cross-site comparisons, and enhance predictive accuracy.
Beyond modeling, the dataset facilitates carbon stock quantification, conservation planning, forest management, and climate policy development.
