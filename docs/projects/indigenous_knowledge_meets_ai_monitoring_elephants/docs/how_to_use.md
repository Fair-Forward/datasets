The Ltome-Katip datasets can already be used to detect and classify species such as elephants and rodents, enabling real-time biodiversity monitoring and alerts for human–wildlife conflict. They also support ecosystem health assessments by capturing patterns in species richness, activity cycles, and climate-driven changes. Indigenous-led early warning systems are already being built using these datasets and dashboards, allowing communities to visualize and act on local ecological shifts. Researchers can extend this work by adding new species, integrating satellite data, applying transfer learning, or developing explainable AI tools to improve accuracy and cross-ecosystem usability. All reuse must respect Indigenous data sovereignty, undergo an ethical AI review, and credit the original communities. The Ltome-Katip core team is actively seeking funding for the next phase — Ltome-Katip 2 — which will expand the sensor network, strengthen community data infrastructure, and integrate AI capabilities into the Namunyak Indigenous app.
