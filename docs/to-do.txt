To Dos:

* Overall overhaup side panel:
    * add links to datasets and use cases also in side panel.
    * add images and also other tags in side panels.
    * make them essentially stand-alone sites to share with others
* Build subpage structure:
    * To share links for specific datasets/use-cases
    * To share link for domain/country etc. 
* Replace "Read More" With "Details" and open directly panels with full information then.
    * Remove dataset/use-case link from card. 
    * Short description line cap to keep cards readable - alternative keep the read more hover but link then?

* Find solution to switch between datasets and use-cases somehow...

* Update script to properly show hyperlinks from excel (should produce hyperlinks itself if possible)

Backlog:

* Re-create with Nextjs or something similar for nicer visualisations.
