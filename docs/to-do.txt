To Dos:

* links to use cases and datasets are not there anymore.
* make header image more transparent on side panel + make tags nicer to see.
* make full card clickable perhaps?
* Find solution to switch between datasets and use-cases somehow...
* Update script to properly show hyperlinks from excel (should produce hyperlinks itself if possible)

Backlog:

* Re-create with Nextjs or something similar for nicer visualisations.
