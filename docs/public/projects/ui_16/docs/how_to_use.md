The TTS models can be used to develop innovative solutions and voice-based services for Indians in their native language. This would be especially beneficial for those who cannot read/write or have speech and visual disabilities but can access digital services through audio/voice-based mediums. The data and models are a crucial stepping stone for developing such assistive technologies. Including low-resource languages, some of which do not even have enough print/digital literature, would benefit vulnerable communities for whom language barriers make access to technological solutions even more difficult. Given the distribution of speakers. some of the languages are especially useful for programmes wishing to engage with rural communities and promote sustainable agriculture in rural settings. The 720 hours of open-source TTS data also present immense opportunities for academic and industrial research.
