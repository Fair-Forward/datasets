This model is trained to predict above-ground biomass (AGB) in tropical and subtropical forests using multi-source satellite imagery at the pixel level. Specifically:

Prediction Unit: Estimates biomass at individual pixel level (typically 10-40m resolution depending on input data)
Output: Biomass density in Mg/ha (megagrams per hectare)
Input Data: Processes multi-sensor data including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, PALSAR, and DEM
Application Scope: Best suited for tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems in South/Southeast Asia
Biomass Range: Validated for forests with biomass between ~40-460 Mg/ha
