There is a significant opportunity to make digitized government services in Kenya more easily discoverable and, by extension, enhance their accessibility and use by citizens through chatbot technology. Based on NLP technology, chatbots can help citizens access information on Kenyaâ€™s eGovernment services through text and voice inputs in Kiswahili and English. This project foresees the development of an AI Conversational Chatbot using the GovStack Building Block Approach - so as to create (a) a chatbot for easier service discoverability; and (b) a chatbot framework that can be reused as a digital public good.
