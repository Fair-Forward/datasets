Ltome-Katip Indigenous Bioacoustic Dataset
Regions: Samburu (Kenya) · Shuar (Ecuadorian Amazon)
Custodians: Chief Titus Letaapo (Samburu tribe) (Namunyak Conservancy), Chief Mario Vargas Shakaim (Shuar Nation) (MUSAP Biological Station), and Space4Innovation
This dataset contains Indigenous-labelled bioacoustic recordings from two ecosystems—semi-arid savannah and tropical rainforest—collected through AudioMoth bioacustic sensors. Data include species-specific sounds (e.g., elephants, rodents), environmental background, and associated metadata following the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.
Use cases: biodiversity monitoring, species classification, human–wildlife conflict alerts, and AI model training for conservation.
Limitations: class imbalance (key species overrepresented), environmental noise, and spatial clustering; users should apply noise filtering and ethical review before reuse. These audio data are collected 24/7 when deployed in time periods ranging from hours to several weeks. The data are acquired from multiple microphones spread across the study site. Each microphone has a unique serial number and the geographic locations are provided using GPS. The data are time stamped, however there are data gaps in time and space due to logistics, equipment failure, or power loss. The original data are stored as 16-bit WAV files and are available. To make the data more widely available, they have been uploaded to the Arbimon.org platform. The Arbimon cloud platform is built for bioacoustics analysis using various ML .
