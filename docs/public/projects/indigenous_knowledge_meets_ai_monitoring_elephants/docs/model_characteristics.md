The Ltome-Katip system uses Indigenous-labelled bioacoustic data to train AI models that detect and classify species like elephants in Samburu (Kenya) and rodents in the Ecuadorian Amazon. These models are already being used to monitor biodiversity, understand ecological stress, and support early warning systems rooted in Indigenous governance. What sets Ltome-Katip apart is that both the dataset and its governance model were co-designed by Indigenous communities. All development follows the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and any replication must go through an Ethical AI Assessment to ensure consent, transparency, and benefit-sharing. This project sets a new global benchmark for community-led, responsible AI in biodiversity and conservation.

The data is processed using the Arbimon platform, where recordings are visualized as spectrograms and labelled through bounding boxes by trained Indigenous data stewards. The outputs — including geospatial and temporal metadata — can be downloaded as CSV files and used for further machine learning or integration with other ecological datasets. These tools are already generating insights into ecosystem change and human–wildlife conflict. The core team is now actively designing Ltome-Katip 2, a next-phase expansion that will deepen Indigenous-led data infrastructure, extend sensor coverage, and explore AI integration with the Namunyak app. While plans are in development, we are currently seeking aligned funding to support this work, which will remain entirely Indigenous-led and ethically governed at every stage.
