The NaijaSenti dataset is the first large-scale human-annotated Twitter sentiment dataset for Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yorùbá, the four most widely spoken languages in Nigeria. It consists of around 30,000 annotated tweets per language (except for Nigerian-Pidgin), including a significant fraction of code-mixed tweets. These datasets are useful not only for sentiment analysis but also for hate speech detection. The open-source package consists of datasets, trained models, sentiment lexicons, and code. With more than 200 million people and 522 native languages, Nigeria is the most populous and linguistically diverse country in Africa, as well as the third most multilingual country in the world. The majority of the population speaks either Hausa, Igbo, Yorùbá, or Nigerian-Pidgin.
