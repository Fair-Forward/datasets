The dataset consists of three parallel corpora: Kidaw'ida-Kiswahili; Kalenjin-Kiswahili; Dholuo-Kiswahili. On averate, each corpus has thirty thousand sentence pairs. This dataset is available on Zenodo and on GitHub where it will continue to be grown and its quality improved. The project had a total of 105 speakers who came from different parts of each region where the three languages are spoken. Thus, different regional accents were included in the speech data, making the dataset more representative. Furthermore, both male and female speakers were contributing to the voice data.
