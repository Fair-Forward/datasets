This web application is a prototype decision support tool designed to guide electrification strategies across various geographic areas. It offers an initial village-level assessment through a color-coded map, with the legend explaining each category. Users can explore detailed analyses at the village levelâ€”the smallest unit for assessing electrification needs. The tool evaluates both demand and supply factors and suggests the most suitable energy solutions, including biomass, wind, solar home systems, mini-grids, or grid extension. It is intended to support government officials, energy sector stakeholders, and development partners in making informed renewable energy decisions.
