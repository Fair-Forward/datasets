The Site Identification tool is an AI-driven tool to enhance renewable energy planning. This tool utilizes machine learning and satellite imagery to identify optimal sites for renewable energy deployment, particularly in remote regions. A successful pilot in Lamwo District demonstrated its potential to improve energy access by recommending suitable electrification strategies for villages. This initiative aligns with Ugandaâ€™s National Electrification Strategy, which seeks to connect 10 million households to the most optimal energy source by 2030.
