This dataset helps to understand energy consumption patterns in relation to weather conditions in Pakistan. This can guide policymaking on energy and energy conservation, sustainabe energy initiatives and private sector use (market assessment and strategic planning as new entrants in the restructured energy market). 
The project produced an energy dataset of residential consumption data from buildings across six climatic zones. The energy dataset is recorded on a 1-minute granularity for entire household usage as well as for individual appliances. With over a year of detailed energy consumption data and 18 months of weather data collected from a diverse array of households across six distinct climatic zones, it is one of the most comprehensive datasets of its kind. This meteorological dataset has been accumulated over a period of 18 months for the six urban centers. This weather data comprises of up to 10 essential variables such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and Precipitation, thus providing an all-around perspective of the environmental elements impacting energy consumption.
