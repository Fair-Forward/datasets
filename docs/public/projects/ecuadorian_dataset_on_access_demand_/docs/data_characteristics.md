Currently, a dataset containing observations incorporating energy consumption and production data (MW/h), as well as meteorological information including temperature, precipitation and wind speed variables, is hosted on Hugging Face. This information is obtained from official sources and measuring devices. As the processed information is public, there are no related ethical issues; however, it is limited to what is shared by official sources.
