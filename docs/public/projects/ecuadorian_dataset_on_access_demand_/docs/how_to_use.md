The project model focuses on predicting incidents within Ecuador's electrical system by integrating consumption and production data with meteorological information (INAMHI) and satellite images to create an AI-driven early warning system. Key use cases include anticipating failures associated with extreme weather, providing in-depth analysis of energy consumption and production through visualisations such as heat maps, and managing energy efficiency at the device level. The main limitations identified were the ongoing challenge of integrating data from multiple official sources, and the need for additional funding to ensure the project's long-term sustainability. Plans to improve and scale up the project focus on integrating the predictive model into the risk management systems of electric utilities and expanding institutional collaboration with CENACE, CELEC and INAMHI to ensure the platform and public dataset are continuously updated.
