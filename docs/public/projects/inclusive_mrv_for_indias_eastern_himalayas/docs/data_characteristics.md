This dataset integrates geospatial and socio-economic information to monitor forest restoration and livelihoods in the Eastern Himalayas. It combines satellite data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PALSAR with 500+ ground truth points and nearly 300 household surveys collected in Assam, Sikkim, and Mizoram. The data support AI applications for biomass estimation, deforestation detection and nature positive impact assessment.
A locally trained biomass model improves accuracy for South Asian forest types, addressing calibration bias in global datasets. All personal identifiers have been removed, and sensitive coordinates anonymized to protect community privacy. The dataset is published under a CC-BY 4.0 license and maintained by Vertify.earth GmbH and Earth Analytics India Pvt Ltd, ensuring its ongoing usability as an open and replicable foundation for environmental AI and digital MRV systems.
