This resource can be of use to anyone interested to automate the task of manual cherry counts (the traditional approach to harvest estimation) and to estimate coffee harvest on a plot level. This is done  by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, this system is useful for anyone interested in building a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member’s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.

This use case also included the development of a business model and funding model for open source AI as a stepping stone towards financially viable operations. It was facilitated by Villgro Africa's and FAIR Forward's  six-month mentorship programme on "Creating sustainable business and funding models with open source AI".
