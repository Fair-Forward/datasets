The datasets can be used directly for energy planning, electrification modelling, mini-grid prefeasibility assessments, academic research, or scenario analysis. Users may download the ML dataset to analyse expected appliance adoption patterns or to integrate the predicted household numbers into broader socio-economic models. The synthetic demand profiles can be imported into any energy modelling environment (e.g., Python, R, Excel, PowerFactory, PyPSA, OSeMOSYS) to simulate grid expansion, evaluate supply adequacy, or study temporal consumption behaviour. Because the full codebase is open source, users can also adapt individual steps of the pipeline—such as updating input features, retraining the ML model with local survey data, or running customized RAMP simulations—to generate new or localized demand profiles. Access to both datasets is free under a CC-BY 4.0 license, and additional resources such as documentation, example scripts, and workshop materials are available via GitHub and Harvard Dataverse. This ensures that researchers, planners, and practitioners can build on the existing workflow at no cost and with minimal technical barriers.
