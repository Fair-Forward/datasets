# Model/Use-Case

Processed Data and Models:
 1. Uses geo-tagged images collected from farms and annotated for crop types, health status, and specific afflictions (pests/diseases/nutrition deficiency) 
 2. Derived vegetation indices, moisture indices, and time-series data from satellite imagery.
 3. A corpus of voice and text data is being developed for local language processing.
 4. Crop classification models using CNN architectures : Identifies 
 5. Crop Yield prediction models 
 6. Language models for agricultural advisory in multiple local languages (in development)
 Application:
 The system can be used for:
 • Early warning of potential crop failure
 • Yield prediction and crop health monitoring
 • Localized agricultural advisory in multiple languages
 • Farm productivity tracking and management
 • Regional agricultural monitoring and planning
