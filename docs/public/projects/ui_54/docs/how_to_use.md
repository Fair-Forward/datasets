The agricultural sector makes a substantial contribution to GDP and livelihoods across the developing world. However, regular and reliable agricultural data remains difficult and expensive to collect on the ground. As a result, policy-makers usually donâ€™t have access to updated data for implementing policies or supporting farmers. Earth observation satellites provide a wealth of multispectral image data that can be used for developing agricultural monitoring tools. These tools support farmers and policy-makers across Africa and the developing world. With this dataset and AI model you can use time-series of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data to classify crops in the Western Cape of South Africa.
