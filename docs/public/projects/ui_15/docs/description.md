Under this initiative, a novel approach is employed by leveraging citizen scientists and IoT-based low-cost sensors to collect hyperlocal air quality data. This data is used to identify pollution sources and risk zones, facilitating targeted actions by regulatory authorities.To showcase data outreach, the project features the VAYU Android-based application and the VAYU citizen portal digital stack, which support targeted interventions and customized solutions backed by AI/ML algorithms. These tools potentially develop new approaches in air pollution management while reducing public investment costs.
