The Accent Classification Dataset (Ghana) is a collection of audio recordings from native and non-native English speakers across Ghana's diverse regions. Participants read the same three scripts, capturing distinct regional accents and speech patterns. This consistent dataset is valuable for linguistic analysis, accent classification, and speech recognition research focused on Ghanaian English.
