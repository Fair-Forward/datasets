You can make use of the existing models on yield prediction and crop type mapping to infer other similar datapoints â€“ for example neighbouring states of Telangana. Additionally, you can try to combine the dataset with other existing open-source datasets from the ADEX platform and conduct research/commercial scoping on these. 
 The present dataset is quite unique in the fact that it includes observations such as irrigation methods, crop health and expected yield. You may combine these with other data sources, i.e. satellite/remote sensing data (open-source or commercial) to build high-quality crop monitoring/recommendation systems to support various agricultural entities, farmers and decision makers in India. This could also inform commercial products. 
 As crop mapping is a prominent use-case, the data can be used for benchmarking different available crop datasets and models or inform foundational geospatial models as well as constitute to a region-wide crop mapping. Potential partners on the ground for collaboration, commercial involvement or funding are the Telangana Government, specifically the IT and Agricultural department and Nabard Dicra.
