This AI application and replication-kit is about an AI-based crop type map for Telangana. This should be of use to anyone wishing to support sustainable farming practices and evidence-based decision-making for agricultural. Also, this can be used to empower you, as a local business, and NGOs, or a government agency to develop digital agricultural applications. The application focuses on creating localized ground-truth data on several different crop related variables to train AI models tailored to Telangana's diverse agricultural landscape. This includes an open-access ground-truth dataset, a data challenge with openly available models for yield prediction, a crop classification model using satellite imagery applied to map the whole state of Telangana, and a roadmap for AI implementation in agriculture. Datasets, AI models, and crop maps are all openly available as an open-source replication kit and digital public good.
