Enabling language translation capabilities on the Moodle LMS platform, through a collaboration with Atingi; the use case explores 3 modes of translation. The first mode is navigation based, simply translating static messages such as buttons and notifications, secondly it explores full content translation, lastly, in-line translation. The project uses the NLLB-200 model for translation, other models could be experimented to explore feasibility of additional features such as QA or summarization, leveraging the plugin built by the team.
