# Data

Wadhwani AI with support from German Development Cooperation provided training data consisting of ca. 13,000 images:
 
 (a) These images were captured by farmers and farm extension workers since 2018
 (b) The dataset contains two types of images: those with pests and bounding boxes labelling either pink bollworm (PBW) or American bollworm (ABW), and those without pests, representing real-world user behavior.
