# Model/Use-Case

Wadhwani AI with support from German Development cooperation provided the codebase of the pest identification model:
 
 (a) At its core, this repository packages an object detection implementation. 
 (b) While there are several object detection implementations, and even implementation aggregations, there are none that completely solve for the challenges faced here (e.g., highly diverse image quality, model size restrictions)
