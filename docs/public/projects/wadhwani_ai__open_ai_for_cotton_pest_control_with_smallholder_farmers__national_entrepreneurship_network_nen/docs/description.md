# Description

Wadhwani AI has developed a mobile app to support cotton farmers combat pest infestations, a major threat to cotton productivity. For this, they have collaborated with FAIR Forward â€“ AI for All, a project of German Development Cooperation. The app allows farmers to take photos of pheromone traps, which capture male bollworms, and uses an AI model to count the pests in the images. Based on the AI-generated counts, the app provides recommendations to farmers on how to respond. This technology empowers small-scale farmers to make informed decisions, reduce uncertainty in yield, and improve their livelihoods.
 
 As the codebase, dataset and research are openly available it can be used to build on, test and research similar applications in other contexts. This would esp. apply to problems of identification and counting of agricultural pests.
