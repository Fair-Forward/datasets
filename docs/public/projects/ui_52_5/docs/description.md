Explores using the Random Forest Regression (RFR) machine learning algorithm with Sentinel-2 and drone imagery to estimate relative chlorophyll values in tomato and maize crops within South Africa's Ha-Mphaila farming area. The research concludes that both Sentinel-2 imagery (10m and 20m spatial resolution) and high-resolution drone images are valuable for rapidly assessing crop chlorophyll content across significant areas, offering useful insights for precision agriculture.
