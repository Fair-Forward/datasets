One can immediately use this AI system to classify landuse and landcover types, detect deforestation, and generate LULC predictions for 2025–2030. Users can replicate the full workflow from preprocessing imagery, training ANN models, and simulating future change scenarios to support forest monitoring, restoration planning, district land-use decision-making, or environmental reporting. Researchers can extend the work by integrating socio-economic variables, testing hybrid models, adding additional years of imagery, or adapting the model to new districts. Replication requires awareness of limitations such as sampling imbalance, image quality differences, and potential classification bias; an ethical-AI review is recommended for all downstream use. Costs remain low because the tools (QGIS, GEE, SEPAL) and datasets are free; only compute for model training (standard PCs) and technical time are required. All datasets, protocols, and documentation form an open public-good resource, with opportunities for collaboration through Makerere AI Lab and NFA.
