This geodatabase contains geospatial information collected and processed under the LACUNA project, aimed at quantifying above-ground biomass (AGB) and above-ground carbon (AGC) in Colombian mangroves, specifically in the VIPIS area (Vía Parque Isla de Salamanca). The data are organized into two main datasets: Ground_truth and Satellite AGB/AGC.
Ground_truth Dataset – Field and reference data:
•  MangroveTrees (point layer): Structural details of individual trees, including DBH, height, species, AGB, and AGC, for trees in 20 sampled plots.
•  MangrovePlot (point layer): Centroids of the 20 plots, with aggregated AGB and AGC per plot.
•  TreesCanopy (polygon layer): Tree canopy projections with attributes linked to MangroveTrees.
•  MangrovePlots (polygon layer): Plot boundaries (10 × 10 m) with estimated AGB and AGC values.
Satellite AGB/AGC Dataset – Remote-sensing derived data:
•  Provides 10 m resolution maps of AGB and AGC for 2025, generated using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data combined with in-situ measurements and a Random Forest machine learning model.
