This open-access dataset supports machine learning (ML) applications for mangrove forest monitoring, addressing the need for more openly available and well-annotated datasets to calibrate and validate ML models. It focuses on improving the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) and above-ground carbon (AGC) in Colombian Caribbean mangroves. The pilot area, Via Parque Isla de Salamanca National Natural Park (VIPIS) in the Magdalena department, is a Ramsar and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Existing global AGB and AGC models often lack the precision and cost-effectiveness needed for regional monitoring.
The dataset includes both plot-level and tree-level field measurements from 20 newly surveyed plots, providing detailed attributes such as DBH, height, species, AGB (from allometric equations), and AGC. Using these field data, high-resolution satellite imagery, and machine learning models, satellite-based AGB and AGC maps covering ~6,000 ha of mangroves at 10 m spatial resolution have also been generated.
