Content:
• 21,031 geocoded cocoa farm polygons (including agroforestry and shadeless cocoa)
• 14,192 homogeneous (shadeless) cocoa polygons digitized from farm plots
• 20,035 additional points/polygons for other land uses (informal gold mining, degraded forest, oil palm, rubber)
• 485 anonymised household clusters (from 4,444 individual surveys) providing socioeconomic context

Collection methods:
• OpenForis Ground (field-based polygon collection)
• Collect Earth Online (land use mapping)
• KoboToolbox (household survey data)

Purpose: Reference dataset for remote sensing, land cover classification, and land use change mapping in cocoa production landscapes.

Limitations:
• Polygons represent portions of farms, not legal or property boundaries.
• Farm sizes do not reflect entire holdings.
• Not suitable for certification or compliance purposes.
