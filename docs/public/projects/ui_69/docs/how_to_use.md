What can be done immediately:
• Train and validate machine learning models for cocoa farm detection, deforestation monitoring, and land use classification.
• Use as a benchmark dataset to evaluate remote sensing products in heterogeneous tropical landscapes.
• Support policy analysis on sustainable cocoa, land degradation, and restoration planning in Ghana.
How to extend or improve:
• Add new field reference data from other cocoa-producing regions (e.g., Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria) to increase transferability.
• Integrate household-level socioeconomic data to study drivers of land use change and cocoa–forest dynamics.
• Combine with climate and soil datasets to model sustainability scenarios.
Limitations / ethical use:
• Must not be used for farm-level regulation or compliance; polygons are reference only.
• Potential imbalances between cocoa vs. non-cocoa land use classes should be addressed in model training.
• Users are encouraged to conduct an ethical AI assessment before deploying derived models.
Cost considerations:
• Dataset itself is open access (no cost).
• Small-scale applications (e.g., testing models in Google Earth Engine or QGIS) incur negligible costs.
• Larger-scale ML training and national-scale mapping may require cloud compute budgets
