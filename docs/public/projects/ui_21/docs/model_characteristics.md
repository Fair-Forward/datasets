Processed Data:
 The ground truth data was combined with open-source Sentinel-2 data to create a geospatial dataset with crop type as labels.
 The processed dataset can be accessed here: Processed Data
 Code for Crop Classification Model:
 Code to create the training data and for training the models for crop mapping can be accessed here: Code
 Application:
 The resulting shapefiles that predict crop type for the state of Telangana are deployed on DICRA â€“ a digital public good ran by the Indian Development Bank NABARD and UNDP: DICRA
 Based on the collected data, GIZ organised a data challenged together with Zindi to build state-of-the-art crop mapping models. The outcomes of the challenge can be accessed here: Zindi
