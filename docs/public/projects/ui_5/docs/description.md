This dataset supports yield estimation, crop type detection and classification, fruit detection and counting, and fruit maturity stage detection (unripe, ripe, and spoiled) for three products that are important sources of livelihood for millions of households in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 
 It contains 14,870 drone images with bounding box annotations of cashew, cocoa, and coffee trees collected across multiple farms in Ghana and Uganda. Conventional methods of yield estimation are expensive, require a lot of labor and time, and are prone to error due to incomplete ground observations. This results in poor crop yield estimations and hinders farmersâ€™ ability to appropriately plan and manage their fields and production pipelines. This dataset will help transform African agriculture into agribusiness by allowing for the development of yield estimation solutions that enable farmers to make good business decisions. Having key details about agricultural production readily accessible enables a timely harvest, helping farmers ensure healthy, fresh produce and, in addition, better sales.
