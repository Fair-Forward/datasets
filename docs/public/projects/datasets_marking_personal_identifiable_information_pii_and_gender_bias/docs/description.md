This dataset contains annotated sentences with personally identifiable information (PII) in Luganda, Lumasaba, Hausa, and Kanuri. These four languages span Central and Eastern Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Northern Cameroon. The team collected 3,000 sentences for both Kanuri and Hausa, 5,000 for Lumasaba, and 4,000 for Luganda. Potential use cases for these datasets include named entity recognition (NER), text classification, privacy-preserving data analysis and research, language modeling, machine translation, and linguistic research.
 
 The team aimed to curate a dataset that is gender inclusive, and their work highlighted the need for standardized guidelines for annotating low-resourced languages. Having these guidelines would help to avoid common pitfalls and errors when labeling text data in these low-resource languages.
