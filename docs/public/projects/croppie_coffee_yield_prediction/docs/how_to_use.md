Instead of manual cherry counts (the traditional approach to harvest estimation), pictures of the coffee branches are used to automate this task. The coffee harvest on a plot level is estimated by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, Croppie serves as a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their memberâ€™s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.
