Unpredictable weather conditions and price fluctuations pose major challenges for coffee farmers in Uganda. The platform and app 'Croppie' supports them with targeted cultivation recommendations and precise crop forecasts—using AI-supported image recognition of coffee plants. As a digital public good based on open-source technology, it can be adapted and further developed locally. The basic user interface is provided through a mobile application. Croppie’s core functionality is to allow for AI-supported coffee yield estimation. This is done by guiding a selective sampling for a statistical yield estimation service based on branch count and coffee branch picture taking, alongside the integration of additional data provided by the user.
