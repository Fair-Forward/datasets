Processed Data:
 Field measurements (e.g., biomass and tree species) were combined with Sentinel-2 imagery and NASA GEDI lidar to enhance map accuracy. The resulting geospatial data includes classifications of High Carbon Stock forests and other land-use categories.
 Model Development:
 AI models, trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and calibrated with aerial LiDAR and ground-truth data, are hosted on the HCSA GitHub repository: HCS Mapping Code.
 Application:
 Validated HCS maps are deployed on Google Earth Engine and Global Forest Watch for conservation planning and policy support, with an ODK-based mobile app under development for offline data collection. The project integrates FPIC (Free, Prior, and Informed Consent) principles throughout, ensuring community involvement and respect for land rights in data collection and mapping.
