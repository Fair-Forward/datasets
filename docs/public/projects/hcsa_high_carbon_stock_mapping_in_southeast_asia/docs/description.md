# Description

This project focuses on creating validated, open-source High Carbon Stock (HCS) forest maps for Indonesia using an AI-driven approach. It adopts the HCS classification system to identify forests suitable for conservation versus sustainable development:
 • High, Medium, and Low-Density Forests (Conservation Priority): Forests with closed or patchy canopies, rich biodiversity, and carbon storage.
 • Young Regenerating Forests: Regrowing forests that are transitioning into higher carbon stock potential.
 • Scrub and Open Land: Areas with minimal carbon stock suitable for sustainable development.
 The maps integrate field data, satellite imagery, and AI to assist policymakers, NGOs, and businesses in making data-driven decisions for sustainable land-use planning and conservation. Stakeholders can use the outputs for spatial planning, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and implementing "no deforestation" commitments. The High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA) project was nominated for the prestigious UN SDG Game Changer award – Category 2: Planet – Innovation for our climate and environment “Artificial Intelligence Meets Jungle/ Forest Forward.
