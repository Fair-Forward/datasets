Mozilla Foundation seeks to select and support a community (group of language speakers who would like to collectively create or enhance a text and audio dataset for their  language), to experiment with a governance structure for this dataset that suits their particular needs. 
This project will enable language communities to leverage governance tools (such as licenses) that center their needs and context, and have them be more accessible and widely used. Over the period of the project, the goal is to have a particular language community, or small group of them, piloting a novel, community-centered license on the Common Voice platform, as a proof of concept that can then be replicated and adapted
