The TTS models can be used to develop innovative solutions and voice-based services for Indians in their native language. This would be especially beneficial for those who cannot read/write or have speech and visual disabilities but can access digital services through audio/voice-based mediums. The data and models are a crucial stepping stone for developing such assistive technologies. Including low-resource languages, some of which do not even have enough print/digital literature, would benefit vulnerable communities for whom language barriers make access to technological solutions even more difficult. The 720 hours of open-source TTS data also present immense opportunities for academic and industrial research.
