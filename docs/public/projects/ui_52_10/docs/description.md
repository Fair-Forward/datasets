Investigates the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of tomato crops in the Ha-Mphaila irrigation scheme, Limpopo Province, South Africa. The research aimed to determine key wavebands and vegetation indices for LAI estimation, compare the performance of RF models with stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models, and map the spatial distribution of LAI.
