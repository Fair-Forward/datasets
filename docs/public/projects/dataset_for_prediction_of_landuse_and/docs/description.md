This project provides Uganda’s first openly accessible AI-ready satellite imagery dataset designed to predict land-use and land-cover change. It was created to address persistent deforestation and the lack of reliable, context-specific data needed to detect, forecast, and manage ecosystem degradation. Through an open-source replication kit including annotated Sentinel-2 and Hansen datasets, protocols, and inventory data, this products enables local innovators, forest agencies, and policymakers to build AI tools for monitoring forests, planning restoration, and supporting NDC and SDG15 actions. Its goal is to improve early detection of land-cover change, strengthen climate-smart decision-making, and empower local institutions with high-quality geospatial data.
