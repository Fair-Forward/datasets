This team annotated 2,125 Google Earth satellite images and 9,202 drone images, forming a combination of low and high-definition solar panel views in Madagascar. The Madagascar Initiatives for Digital Innovation (MAIDI) team performed field checks for up to 25% of satellite images and, in total, annotated 22,488 polygons.
 
 This dataset will help data scientists and users develop a solar panel detection algorithm to measure solar energy adoption across Madagascar. Notably, this project represented all regions of the country; instead of focusing only on big cities, it also covered average and small villages as well as coasts and mountains.
