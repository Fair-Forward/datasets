Supporting Minority Languages in the Digital Space:

The digital divide is often more pronounced for speakers of minority and underrepresented languages. Including these languages in summarization datasets helps bridge this gap, ensuring that digital platforms and technologies are accessible and beneficial to a broader range of linguistic communities.

Encouraging Linguistic Research

The creation of NusaDialogue can stimulate interest and research in linguistics, language preservation, and computational linguistics. This can lead to a better understanding of the unique linguistic features of these languages and the development of more tailored language technologies.

Addressing Bias and Fairness in NLP

Through NusaDialogue , there is an opportunity to address biases present in NLP systems that are often trained on data from dominant languages. This can contribute to the development of more fair and unbiased language technologies.

In conclusion, the social impact of NusaDialogue extends beyond technology to cultural preservation, education, inclusivity, and cross-cultural understanding. It has the potential to empower communities, promote linguistic diversity, and contribute to a more equitable and interconnected global society.
