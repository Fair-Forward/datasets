NusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs. The dialogues in NusaDialogue encompass numerous topics including culture, occupation, politics, science, history, news, sports, religion, etc. The non-translationese annotation nature makes NusaDialogue suitable for representing the actual day-to-day use of these underrepresented languages. In addition, we ensure that the dataset is annotated by a balanced number of male and female annotators to make the dataset represent a more balanced demography.
