 FAIR Forward and Prosa.ai collected AI training data and trained models for three digitally underrepresented languages of Indonesia: Balinese, Bugis and Minangkabau. Existing works on underrepresented languages mostly focus on machine translation and simple language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification. More complex tasks such as open-domain dialogue and dialogue summarization, are still left behind for these underrepresented languages which leads to a poor evaluation suite for assessing the capability of large language models (LMs) in these underrepresented languages. Mitigating this limitation, we introduce NusaDialogue, the first underrepresented languages datasets consisting of manually annotated dialogue along with its summary.

NusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs. The dialogues in NusaDialogue encompass numerous topics including culture, occupation, politics, science, history, news, sports, religion, etc
