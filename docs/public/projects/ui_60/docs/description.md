The Lacuna PII Multilingual Text Dataset  contains annotated sentences with personally identifiable information (PII) in Luganda, Lumasaba, Hausa, and Kanuri. These four languages span Central and Eastern Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Northern Cameroon. The dataset can help to anonymize and pseudonymize personally identifiable information in AI tasks. This can help organizations comply with legal requirements while still being able to analyze and use and share their data effectively. It can also be used to improve machine translation systems for low-resource languages,  improve the performance of NLP applications in these languages, and support the extraction of specific information from text, such as automated form filling and information retrieval systems. It comprises 4000 Luganda sentences, 5000 Lumasaba sentences, 3000 Kanuri sentences, and 3000 Hausa sentences. The team aimed to curate a dataset that is gender inclusive. It was created by Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab in collaboration with Marconi Lab and Clear Global.
