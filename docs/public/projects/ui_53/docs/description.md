Univ of Stellenbosch Grant (Febe de Wet) - Voices of Mzansi project aimed to get South Africa's languages launched on the Mozilla Common Voice platform1. To achieve this aim the Common Voice website had to be translated from English into the other official languages and at least 5 000 sentences had to be collected for each language. The collected sentences have to be available in the open domain under CC-0 licensing. Once a languages is launched, the sentences are used as prompts for speech data collection through the Common Voice platform.
