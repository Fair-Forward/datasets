The dataset can help to build systems, that can monitor the impact of palm oil monoculture, shrimp aquaculture, mining and other land transformations in continental Ecuador and Galapagos. The project created a 20.000 points land use/cover classification training dataset from existing data, with labels that can be used to train multi-spectral Earth observation (EO) data machine learning (ML)  models covering continental Ecuador and the Galapagos islands.
