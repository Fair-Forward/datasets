This dataset will allow for a better understanding of land transformation dynamics taking place, such as forest conversion to palm oil monoculture, mangrove transformation to shrimp aquaculture, water bodies and estuarine vegetation impacted by mining, natural grasslands encroached upon by expanding forest plantation, and more. It also has the potential to identify recovery cases. For example, the Galapagos data might provide the ability to estimate if invasive species control programs have had a positive impact in vegetation regeneration or if governmental forest incentives are promoting deforestation reduction in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The landâ€™s conservation status has the potential to predict risk of future transformation.
