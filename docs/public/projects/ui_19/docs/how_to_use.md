The Mundari TTS dataset corpus includes recordings from two different speakers: a female speaker and a male speaker. The female speaker contributed 19,868 recordings, while the male speaker contributed 7,002 recordings.

The total size of the corpus is approximately 17 GB (7 GB compressed). Therefore, the full dataset is hosted in cloud storage (instead of this github repository). This repository contains a sample of 100 recordings from each speaker. Please email data@karya.in for a link to download the full dataset.
