This project developed a efficient AI-powered method and dataset for monitoring of trees in forests in Kenya. Accurate tree crown detection and other parameters will support reforestation efforts in several ways: The datasets enable the development of tools that can rapidly assess the success of reforestation efforts by enabling counting of trees, estimation of treesâ€™ biophysical parameters from drone images, and prediction of tree growth in relation to tree species and weather variables. The data consists of a high-resolution dataset of drone imagery, ground truth tree parameter measurements, and aggregate weather data from a large, reforested area in Kenya.
