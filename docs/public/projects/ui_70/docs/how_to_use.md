Effective forest management and conservation require monitoring tree attributes such as height, crown diameter, and tree count to assess growth in reforested areas. These data enable the development of tools that can speed up the process to assess the success of reforestation efforts and other various ecological and forestry applications, including biomass estimation, forest health assessment, and carbon sequestration studies. Such tools could include the automated counting of trees, estimation of treesâ€™ biophysical parameters from drone images such as tree crown diameter, and prediction of tree growth in relation to tree species and weather variables. In all these areas, AI can offer a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional methods of monitoring and counting.

Concretely the following areas of restoration can be improved:
1) Planning - create baseline assessment: By automatically detecting existing tree crowns, tools based on this dataset can create a baseline assessment of the current forest cover. This information is valuable for planning and prioritizing reforestation areas.
2) Monitor Progress: Repeated application of the tree crown detection model can track the success of reforestation initiatives. The model can quantify the increase in tree cover over time, allowing for informed adjustments to reforestation strategies.
