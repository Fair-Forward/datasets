The Crop Disease data set contains images of diseases data found in tomatoes, pepper and maize. The data was collected in 10 districts of the Ashanti Region of Ghana by the RAIL-KNUST team and the Plant Protection and Research Services Directorate (PPRSD) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. A 3-month long data challenge was hosted on Zindi based on this data set and the 3 winning models are also available as open source resources to serve as your base models in your research into crop diseases in Ghana.
