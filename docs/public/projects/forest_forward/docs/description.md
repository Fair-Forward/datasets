# Description

Mapping carbon content in forests: This application leverages advanced geospatial technologies, such as remote sensing and AI, to support forest conservation efforts in India. The application will allow stakeholders to better monitor forest health, estimate biomass, and contribute to climate mitigation efforts.
 Fire Vulnerability Mapping: This application would help develop a fire vulnerability map which could help to identify areas that are prone to fires based on several forest degradation indicators.
