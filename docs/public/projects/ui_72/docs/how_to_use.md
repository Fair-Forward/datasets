The primary application of this work will include identifying indigenous species that can enhance ecological resilience by mapping adaptation and mitigation opportunities and assessing climate risks to African trees. Existing cutting-edge functional niche modeling will allow for the identification of areas for optimal use of African trees based on the results of tree growth performance. This will promote the use of indigenous trees for reforestation, regenerative agriculture, ecological restoration, human health and livelihood support, and urban afforestation programs to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
