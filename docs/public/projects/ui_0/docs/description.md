Imagine, that you are a small-holder farmer in Ghana fearing  crop disease in your Cashew farm. You also know that early intervention could increase yields by up to 30%  - The Cashew Disease Identification (CADI AI) dataset and application is there to make early detection of diseases in cashew plantations in Ghana through AI possible. This helps securing livelihoods, boosting food security, and fueling further economic growth. You will be able to use an openly accessible data set (4,736 UAV images), a machine learning model, and a desktop app to replicate this approach.
