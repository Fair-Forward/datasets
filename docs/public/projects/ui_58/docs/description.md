The "Development of Unbiased AI Models for Solar Irradiance in Rural Africa" project aims to improve the accuracy of solar irradiation estimates in Africa by combining ground-based measurements with satellite data and AI models. Led by Makerere University's Marconi Lab, the project addresses the lack of reliable solar data—especially in rural areas—by collecting new data, correcting existing biases, and developing a tool to support better solar energy planning and deployment.
