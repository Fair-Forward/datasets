As the world's largest tropical rainforest, Indonesia’s forests are disappearing faster than decision-makers can respond—largely due to the lack of accessible and trusted data. Our project delivers validated, open-source High Carbon Stock forest maps, using AI and satellite imagery to identify high-carbon, high-biodiversity forests, regenerating forests, and low-carbon land suitable for sustainable development.

The data is public, transparent, and scalable, empowering NGOs, indigenous communities, and governments to prevent deforestation and reduce emissions into actionable classes:

High, Medium, and Low-Density Forests (Conservation Priority):
Forests with closed or patchy canopies, high biodiversity value, and significant carbon storage that are essential for climate mitigation and ecosystem protection.

Young Regenerating Forests:
Transitional forests with growing carbon sequestration potential, requiring forward-looking protection strategies to prevent future deforestation.

Scrub and Open Land:
Low-carbon areas suitable for sustainable development, enabling economic growth without compromising forest integrity.

Impact & Use Cases

The resulting maps empower:

- Policymakers: to strengthen spatial planning and climate-aligned land-use policies

- NGOs: to prioritize conservation efforts and monitor forest loss

- Businesses: to meet “no deforestation” commitments, reduce supply-chain risk, and cut greenhouse gas emissions

Global Recognition & Scalability
The approach aligns with the globally recognized HCS methodology and has been nominated for the UN SDG Game Changer award – Category 2: Planet – Innovation for our climate and environment “Artificial Intelligence Meets Jungle/ Forest Forward—a strong signal of technical credibility and market relevance. From Indonesia, the project adaptation scale on demand by Goa government, India and Senegal, West Africa.
