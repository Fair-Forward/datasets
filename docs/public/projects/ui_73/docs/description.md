Mangroves are valuable coastal ecosystems, providing diverse services to humans and playing a critical role in the global strategy to mitigate impacts of climate change. Regular monitoring of their conditions is essential to provide evidence that supports timely decisions for their management. The “Benin Mangroves Open Data (BeMOD)” project generated annotated images, observations on water quality, observations on soil characteristics, climate observations, forest inventories data (tree diversity, canopy height and cover, tree diameter, total height, biomass, etc.) from plots, and data on socio-cultural contexts (e.g., uses, activities) of mangroves in multiple sites in Benin.
