Deforestation is a significant contributor to changes in land use/cover in Uganda. This challenge is intensified by agricultureâ€™s extreme vulnerability to climate change. This project has generated datasets that can be utilized to predict land cover types or changes for informed decision-making in natural resource management. The data is accessible, quality satellite imagery datasets and National Forestry Inventory datasets.  Specifically, Sentinel 2 and Hansen tree cover image datasets have been augmented with the inclusion of inventory datasets. A biomass mean stock per hectare dataset for each vegetation type has also been acquired. Annotation procedures of the different datasets allow for machine learning tasks.
