Supporting the Masakhane network to develop an NLP data catalogue, handbook, datasheets, and governance models for management of catalogue, see https://www.masakhane.io/

1.  Development of an African NLP Data Collection Handbook
This handbook will compile learnings and recommendations from the language data collection experiences of those amongst our ranks and others within our network who have undertaken this work. 

2. Management and Maintenance of an AfricaNLP data catalogue 
Lanfrica is a platform that catalogues and links African language resources to make localised African content accessible and discoverable with a centralised African NLP catalogue.

3. Case Studies on IP, Copyright and Fair Use in Africa
Researchers often approach 'access to data' requests, for research purposes, with a western mindset, which assumes fair use. However the Masakhane approach requires engaging data owners, sharing intentions and asking for permission, a process for which some templates exist. The case study explores partnership models that would enable us to access data and these can also be documented. Here, a minimum of 5 case studies detail how our Masakhane approach have unfolded with several data owners in Africa.

4. Tooling for Data Statements
Datasheets for datasets is a tool for documenting the datasets used for training and evaluating machine learning models. Datasheets intend to increase dataset transparency and facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers (e.g., those using datasets to train machine learning models).
