This dataset and the models developed from it aim to predict biomass levels in shaded regions of CÃ´te d'Ivoire using a combination of GEDI, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and ground truth biomass measurements. The resulting models enable efficient and cost-effective remote monitoring of biomass changes, crucial for assessing reforestation success and detecting forest degradation due to cocoa farming, reducing the need for extensive on-the-ground surveys.
