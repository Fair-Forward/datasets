The AI model based on this dataset enables efficient and cost-effective remote monitoring of biomass changes. This is crucial for assessing reforestation success and detecting forest degradation due to cocoa farming. Also it reduces the need for extensive and expensive on-the-ground surveys. The dataset and the models developed from it aim to predict biomass levels in shaded regions of CÃ´te d'Ivoire using a combination of GEDI, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and ground truth biomass measurements.
