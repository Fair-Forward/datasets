Processed Data and Pretrained Models:
 Use the multilingual datasets and pre-trained models (IndoBERT, IndoBERTNusa) to detect climate misinformation. The processed dataset can be accessed here: Processed Data
 
 Code for AI Models:
 Access the GitHub repository containing scripts for preprocessing datasets, fine-tuning language models, and training disinformation classifiers. These can be customized for various applications.
 
 Application Deployment:
 The resulting models are integrated into platforms like Kominfo's Anti-Hoax portal and social media crawling APIs. Additionally, a chatbot leveraging these AI models is available to verify climate-related information in real-time. The chatbot and models are publicly accessible via APIs to support further innovation and integration by developers.
