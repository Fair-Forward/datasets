# Description

the challenge was organized to predict biomass in shaded regions (cocoa plantations) in Cote d’Ivoire based on GEDI, Sentinel-2 and ground truth biomass data. Remote monitoring of the increase of biomass will help measure the impact of reforestation efforts in Cote d’Ivoire as well as detect degradation of forests due to cocoa, without requiring expensive and labor-intensive biomass estimates on the ground.
