The database provides information on tree/plant-level, plot-level and landscape scale across Kenya. Measurements such as DBH, tree height, canopy size and tree identification have been provided. In addition, socio-economic data such as agroforestry systems (AFSs) preferences, gender roles, and youth participation in AFSs are also provided. The datasets are readily and freely available to users who can integrate it to AI and ML algorithms and models as ground-truth data to train and/or validate the models associated and/or related to agroforestry and carbon sequestration across Kenya. The models developed using the Agrof4Resilience data could utilize and take advantage of satellite data from various sources that are both freely available or with commercial licences.
