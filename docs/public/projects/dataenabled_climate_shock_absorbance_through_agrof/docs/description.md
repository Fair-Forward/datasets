The Agrof4Resilience geospatial datasets are open-access utilized by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms that are aimed at creating more robust, productive, resilient and diverse agro-ecological systems to achieve productive agro-ecosystems that have potential to improve resilience over time. This is crucial especially in dryland which are plagued with land degredation and other effects of climate change. The data demonstrates that agroforestry in Kenya is fairly low while models developed from the data indicate high agroforestry potential in Kenya. This is affected by socioeconomic factors such as education levels, occupation, age, landsize, income, gender, marital status, cultural beliefs, and family size. These datasets could be utilized to demostrate regions and practices that are environementally and socio-economically sound. This could provide insights on practices that could enhance livelihoods and promote environmental resilience in target communities across Kenya. The data was collected from 35 out of 47 counties in Kenya, spread across four predetermined transects that cover four main agro-ecological zones, and stored in a freely accessible database within icipe’s servers.
