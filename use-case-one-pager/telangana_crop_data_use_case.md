## What this is about and how can I use this?

This AI application and replication kit is designed for AI-based crop type mapping in Telangana. It enables:
- Sustainable farming practices.
- Evidence-based agricultural decision-making.
- Empowerment of local businesses, NGOs, and government agencies to develop digital agricultural tools.

Key features include:
- Localized ground-truth data.
- Open-access datasets, models, and maps.
- Roadmap for AI implementation in agriculture.
