All three languages are low resource, especially Kidaw'ida, which has only around 400,000 speakers and is at immediate risk of loss. By collecting the text and speech data, the project has taken a step towards preservation of these languages . The dataset consists of three parallel corpora: Kidaw'ida-Kiswahili; Kalenjin-Kiswahili; Dholuo-Kiswahili. On average, each corpus has thirty thousand sentence pairs. 

In addition, the dataset has helped to preserve, revitalise and elevate the languages Kidaw'ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo by making them work on Mozillas Common Voice Platform. The text and speech datasets are thereby supporting crowd-sourced voice recognition, promoting linguistic diversity and empoweromg local communities by enabling Natural Language Processing applications tailored to their needs. Namely, the resulting voice recognition datasets can be used to build AI voice applications such as advisory systems in local languages for farmers, citizens etc that ""understand"" speech input (instead of written input). As of August 2025, 120 hours of speech data have been recorded on Common Voice in Dholuo (with 14692 sentences available), 92 hours have been recorded for Kalendjin (With 29900 sentences available) and 56 hours have been recorded for Kidaw'ida (with 11773 sentences available).

It can also serve to support sustainable forest management practices and empower local communities in forest resource management. 

The project created open and accessible training and evaluation datasets for machine learning applications focused on forest cover and change in Indonesia. It contains collections of polygons of uniform land cover, with labels indicating land cover type and, possibly, information on land cover change over time. To label land cover patches, the team has reviewed high-resolution satellite imagery facilitated by Collect Earth Online (CEO) and augmented it with field visits to difficult-to-classify areas. It has prioritized areas with significant landcover diversity with a preference for areas with significant smallholder production of  oil palm, coconut, and other commodities - given the well-known difficulties of distinguishing oil palm 
from coconut palm with lower resolution imagery.

Possible users of these outputs are local communities engaged in community forestry in Indonesia, as well as researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations. The dataset also contributes to social forestry, which recognizes that people who depend on local forests are best placed to look after them, and that allowing communities to manage and use forest resources can have positive social, environmental and economic impacts.

1.  Development of an African NLP Data Collection Handbook
This handbook will compile learnings and recommendations from the language data collection experiences of those amongst our ranks and others within our network who have undertaken this work. 

2. Management and Maintenance of an AfricaNLP data catalogue 
Lanfrica is a platform that catalogues and links African language resources to make localised African content accessible and discoverable with a centralised African NLP catalogue.

3. Case Studies on IP, Copyright and Fair Use in Africa
Researchers often approach 'access to data' requests, for research purposes, with a western mindset, which assumes fair use. However the Masakhane approach requires engaging data owners, sharing intentions and asking for permission, a process for which some templates exist. The case study explores partnership models that would enable us to access data and these can also be documented. Here, a minimum of 5 case studies detail how our Masakhane approach have unfolded with several data owners in Africa.

4. Tooling for Data Statements
Datasheets for datasets is a tool for documenting the datasets used for training and evaluating machine learning models. Datasheets intend to increase dataset transparency and facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers (e.g., those using datasets to train machine learning models).

Existing works on underrepresented languages mostly focus on machine translation and simple language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification. More complex tasks such as open-domain dialogue and dialogue summarization, are still left behind for these underrepresented languages which leads to a poor evaluation suite for assessing the capability of large language models (LMs) in these underrepresented languages. Mitigating this limitation, we introduce NusaDialogue, the first underrepresented languages datasets consisting of manually annotated dialogue along with its summary.

NusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs. The dialogues in NusaDialogue encompass numerous topics including culture, occupation, politics, science, history, news, sports, religion, etc",prosa-text/nusa-dialogue · Datasets at Hugging Face,,"SDG 10 (Reduced inequality through access to info in local languages/NLP), End hunger, achieve food security, sustainable agriculture (SDG 2)",Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case,Text,,"NusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs.

In addition, we ensure that the dataset is annotated by a balanced number of male and female annotators to make the dataset represent a more balanced demography.",,"Supporting Minority Languages in the Digital Space:

The digital divide is often more pronounced for speakers of minority and underrepresented languages. Including these languages in summarization datasets helps bridge this gap, ensuring that digital platforms and technologies are accessible and beneficial to a broader range of linguistic communities.

Encouraging Linguistic Research

The creation of NusaDialogue can stimulate interest and research in linguistics, language preservation, and computational linguistics. This can lead to a better understanding of the unique linguistic features of these languages and the development of more tailored language technologies.

Addressing Bias and Fairness in NLP

Through NusaDialogue , there is an opportunity to address biases present in NLP systems that are often trained on data from dominant languages. This can contribute to the development of more fair and unbiased language technologies.

In conclusion, the social impact of NusaDialogue extends beyond technology to cultural preservation, education, inclusivity, and cross-cultural understanding. It has the potential to empower communities, promote linguistic diversity, and contribute to a more equitable and interconnected global society.","Powered by: Prosa.ai

","The agricultural sector makes a substantial contribution to GDP and livelihoods across the developing world. However, regular and reliable agricultural data remains difficult and expensive to collect on the ground. As a result, policy-makers usually don’t have access to updated data for implementing policies or supporting farmers. Earth observation satellites provide a wealth of multispectral image data that can be used for developing agricultural monitoring tools.

 - Model
 Application:
 The dataset/model can be used for automated cherry count or coffee ripeness assessment.","Instead of manual cherry counts (the traditional approach to harvest estimation), pictures of the coffee branches are used to automate this task. The coffee harvest on a plot level is estimated by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, Croppie serves as a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member’s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.","Powered by:
