The second dataset consists of high-resolution synthetic electricity demand profiles generated with the RAMP tool, offering minute-by-minute load curves for an entire year for each adm2 region. Together, these datasets provide a unique, representative, and scalable foundation for understanding residential electricity demand in regions where measured data is scarce or entirely unavailable.","https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/3S7KPQ, https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/9WT7FJ",,SDG 7,Dataset,Geospatial/Remote Sensing,Reiner Lemoine Institut gGmbH (RLI),"
The two datasets provide complementary, high-resolution information on household electricity demand across 1,209 administrative level 2 regions in West Africa. The ML dataset contains per-region estimates of household numbers, appliance ownership across 17 categories, and cluster identifiers reflecting typical appliance-use behaviour. The demand dataset includes both full-year, minute-resolution load profiles (527,040 time steps per region) and aggregated daily curves, along with summary statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, and total annual demand. Files are structured as standardized CSVs, organized by country, and kept in manageable sizes. Users can easily import the data into analytical workflows for energy planning, electrification modelling, scenario design, or spatial analysis. Because the pipeline is fully open source, users may also retrain models, adjust appliance usage parameters, or generate new simulations tailored to local contexts. Together, the datasets offer granular, scalable, and customizable inputs for researchers, utilities, developers, and policymakers working on electricity access and energy-system planning.",,"The datasets can be used directly for energy planning, electrification modelling, mini-grid prefeasibility assessments, academic research, or scenario analysis. Users may download the ML dataset to analyse expected appliance adoption patterns or to integrate the predicted household numbers into broader socio-economic models. The synthetic demand profiles can be imported into any energy modelling environment (e.g., Python, R, Excel, PowerFactory, PyPSA, OSeMOSYS) to simulate grid expansion, evaluate supply adequacy, or study temporal consumption behaviour. Because the full codebase is open source, users can also adapt individual steps of the pipeline—such as updating input features, retraining the ML model with local survey data, or running customized RAMP simulations—to generate new or localized demand profiles. Access to both datasets is free under a CC-BY 4.0 license, and additional resources such as documentation, example scripts, and workshop materials are available via GitHub and Harvard Dataverse. This ensures that researchers, planners, and practitioners can build on the existing workflow at no cost and with minimal technical barriers.","Powered by:  Reiner Lemoine Institut gGmbH (RLI)

However, its main limitation is the availability of data from official sources, as it requires satellite images and meteorological information from INAMHI to operate.","The project model focuses on predicting incidents within Ecuador's electrical system by integrating consumption and production data with meteorological information (INAMHI) and satellite images to create an AI-driven early warning system. Key use cases include anticipating failures associated with extreme weather, providing in-depth analysis of energy consumption and production through visualisations such as heat maps, and managing energy efficiency at the device level. The main limitations identified were the ongoing challenge of integrating data from multiple official sources, and the need for additional funding to ensure the project's long-term sustainability. Plans to improve and scale up the project focus on integrating the predictive model into the risk management systems of electric utilities and expanding institutional collaboration with CENACE, CELEC and INAMHI to ensure the platform and public dataset are continuously updated.","Powered by:  ESPOL University

Co-created by Indigenous data stewards from the Samburu tribe in northern Kenya and the Shuar Nation in the Ecuadorian Amazon, the recordings focus on two sentinel species: Ltome (elephant) and Katip (rodent), both of which signal ecological shifts under climate stress. All data were collected, annotated, and governed by the Indigenous communities, following locally defined protocols rooted in Indigenous data sovereignty. These datasets are not only scientifically valuable — they establish a precedent for how Indigenous communities can lead in setting standards for responsible, consent-based AI development.",https://arbimon.org/p/namunyak-conservancy-reteti-elephant-sanctuary; https://arbimon.org/p/shakiam-ecuadorian-amazon/insights,,SDG 15,Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case,Voice,"Space4Innovation, Diana Mastracci (diana@space4innovation.com)","Ltome-Katip Indigenous Bioacoustic Dataset
Regions: Samburu (Kenya) · Shuar (Ecuadorian Amazon)
Custodians: Chief Titus Letaapo (Samburu tribe) (Namunyak Conservancy), Chief Mario Vargas Shakaim (Shuar Nation) (MUSAP Biological Station), and Space4Innovation
This dataset contains Indigenous-labelled bioacoustic recordings from two ecosystems—semi-arid savannah and tropical rainforest—collected through AudioMoth bioacustic sensors. Data include species-specific sounds (e.g., elephants, rodents), environmental background, and associated metadata following the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.
Use cases: biodiversity monitoring, species classification, human–wildlife conflict alerts, and AI model training for conservation.
Limitations: class imbalance (key species overrepresented), environmental noise, and spatial clustering; users should apply noise filtering and ethical review before reuse. These audio data are collected 24/7 when deployed in time periods ranging from hours to several weeks. The data are acquired from multiple microphones spread across the study site. Each microphone has a unique serial number and the geographic locations are provided using GPS. The data are time stamped, however there are data gaps in time and space due to logistics, equipment failure, or power loss. The original data are stored as 16-bit WAV files and are available. To make the data more widely available, they have been uploaded to the Arbimon.org platform. The Arbimon cloud platform is built for bioacoustics analysis using various ML . 


","The Ltome-Katip system uses Indigenous-labelled bioacoustic data to train AI models that detect and classify species like elephants in Samburu (Kenya) and rodents in the Ecuadorian Amazon. These models are already being used to monitor biodiversity, understand ecological stress, and support early warning systems rooted in Indigenous governance. What sets Ltome-Katip apart is that both the dataset and its governance model were co-designed by Indigenous communities. All development follows the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and any replication must go through an Ethical AI Assessment to ensure consent, transparency, and benefit-sharing. This project sets a new global benchmark for community-led, responsible AI in biodiversity and conservation.

The data is processed using the Arbimon platform, where recordings are visualized as spectrograms and labelled through bounding boxes by trained Indigenous data stewards. The outputs — including geospatial and temporal metadata — can be downloaded as CSV files and used for further machine learning or integration with other ecological datasets. These tools are already generating insights into ecosystem change and human–wildlife conflict. The core team is now actively designing Ltome-Katip 2, a next-phase expansion that will deepen Indigenous-led data infrastructure, extend sensor coverage, and explore AI integration with the Namunyak app. While plans are in development, we are currently seeking aligned funding to support this work, which will remain entirely Indigenous-led and ethically governed at every stage.","The Ltome-Katip datasets can already be used to detect and classify species such as elephants and rodents, enabling real-time biodiversity monitoring and alerts for human–wildlife conflict. They also support ecosystem health assessments by capturing patterns in species richness, activity cycles, and climate-driven changes. Indigenous-led early warning systems are already being built using these datasets and dashboards, allowing communities to visualize and act on local ecological shifts. Researchers can extend this work by adding new species, integrating satellite data, applying transfer learning, or developing explainable AI tools to improve accuracy and cross-ecosystem usability. All reuse must respect Indigenous data sovereignty, undergo an ethical AI review, and credit the original communities. The Ltome-Katip core team is actively seeking funding for the next phase — Ltome-Katip 2 — which will expand the sensor network, strengthen community data infrastructure, and integrate AI capabilities into the Namunyak Indigenous app.","Powered by:  Space4Innovation, Namunyak Conservancy, GEO Indigenous Alliance, MUSAP & Rochester Institute for Technology

The project was created in response to a persistent data gap in the Himalayan region where limited open data and difficult terrain have hindered effective monitoring of forest degradation and the impact of restoration programs. Using locally calibrated AI models trained on Indian biomass data, the system combines satellite observations with ground level socio-economic surveys to measure forest dependency, identify degradation hotspots and track restoration outcomes. All datasets ranging from community level livelihood surveys in Sikkim and Mizoram to forest biomass and land use layers in Assam are openly available. Together they form a replicable, open-source “digital public good” that can be used to train local AI models for forest monitoring, biodiversity accounting or impact assessment. By providing a scalable, context-aware dataset, this initiative enables indigenous start-ups, environmental NGOs and impact investors to quantify nature positive outcomes, align with IRIS+ indicators, and guide conservation investments.
The goal is to make environmental monitoring inclusive and data driven, empowering local actors to track changes in forest carbon, identify erosion risks and measure the socio-economic benefits of restoration.

Existing works on underrepresented languages mostly focus on machine translation and simple language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification. More complex tasks such as open-domain dialogue and dialogue summarization, are still left behind for these underrepresented languages which leads to a poor evaluation suite for assessing the capability of large language models (LMs) in these underrepresented languages. Mitigating this limitation, we introduce NusaDialogue, the first underrepresented languages datasets consisting of manually annotated dialogue along with its summary.

NusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs.

The digital divide is often more pronounced for speakers of minority and underrepresented languages. Including these languages in summarization datasets helps bridge this gap, ensuring that digital platforms and technologies are accessible and beneficial to a broader range of linguistic communities.

Encouraging Linguistic Research

The creation of NusaDialogue can stimulate interest and research in linguistics, language preservation, and computational linguistics. This can lead to a better understanding of the unique linguistic features of these languages and the development of more tailored language technologies.

Addressing Bias and Fairness in NLP

Through NusaDialogue , there is an opportunity to address biases present in NLP systems that are often trained on data from dominant languages. This can contribute to the development of more fair and unbiased language technologies.

In conclusion, the social impact of NusaDialogue extends beyond technology to cultural preservation, education, inclusivity, and cross-cultural understanding.

The project created open and accessible training and evaluation datasets for machine learning applications focused on forest cover and change in Indonesia. It contains collections of polygons of uniform land cover, with labels indicating land cover type and, possibly, information on land cover change over time. To label land cover patches, the team has reviewed high-resolution satellite imagery facilitated by Collect Earth Online (CEO) and augmented it with field visits to difficult-to-classify areas. It has prioritized areas with significant landcover diversity with a preference for areas with significant smallholder production of  oil palm, coconut, and other commodities - given the well-known difficulties of distinguishing oil palm 
from coconut palm with lower resolution imagery.

Possible users of these outputs are local communities engaged in community forestry in Indonesia, as well as researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations.

All three languages are low resource, especially Kidaw'ida, which has only around 400,000 speakers and is at immediate risk of loss. By collecting the text and speech data, the project has taken a step towards preservation of these languages . The dataset consists of three parallel corpora: Kidaw'ida-Kiswahili; Kalenjin-Kiswahili; Dholuo-Kiswahili. On average, each corpus has thirty thousand sentence pairs. 

In addition, the dataset has helped to preserve, revitalise and elevate the languages Kidaw'ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo by making them work on Mozillas Common Voice Platform. The text and speech datasets are thereby supporting crowd-sourced voice recognition, promoting linguistic diversity and empoweromg local communities by enabling Natural Language Processing applications tailored to their needs. Namely, the resulting voice recognition datasets can be used to build AI voice applications such as advisory systems in local languages for farmers, citizens etc that ""understand"" speech input (instead of written input). As of August 2025, 120 hours of speech data have been recorded on Common Voice in Dholuo (with 14692 sentences available), 92 hours have been recorded for Kalendjin (With 29900 sentences available) and 56 hours have been recorded for Kidaw'ida (with 11773 sentences available).

Traditional channels—like radio, TV, and online sources—offer limited reach and interactivity, while extension services and a national call center, staffed by only two agents for over two million farmers, face capacity constraints. To address these gaps, C4IR Rwanda, with support from GIZ Fair Forward (funder) and KiNLP (technology partner), developed a 24/7 AI-enabled Interactive Voice Response (IVR) tool for the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. Accessible via a Kinyarwanda-speaking hotline, this tool will provide critical support such as pest and disease diagnosis, agro-climatic advisories, and updates on MINAGRI’s programs, including crop insurance and climate-resilient practices. By utilizing AI and IVR technology, this project will make agricultural advisories more accessible, timely, and responsive to farmers’ needs.",will come? ,,"SDG 10, SDG 2",Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case,,Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Rwanda (info@c4ir.rw),,,"Currently, the voice bot is not publicly accessible.","Powered by: MINAGRI, C4IR Rwanda and KiNLP

The crop mapping pipeline can be used to map the four most important staple foods in Rwanda (rice, maize, beans, Irish potatoes) in four Rwandan districts, and produce timely, 10-meter resolution crop type maps. Reference data from different sources including project field work, global research projects, and Rwandan authorities were used to fine-tune the geospatial foundational model Galileo for the downstream task of mapping what type of crop grows where. The reference data collected in the field was supported through the creation of polygon labels with PlanetScope imagery in collaboration with Rwandan academia. The crop mapping pipeline, the fine-tuned model, and the project's reference data are openly available for further usage. The overall good accuracy yielded by the approach under conditions with small field sizes, varying elevation and high cloud cover are promising for a successful application in all kinds of regions. Nevertheless, local reference data remains crucial for crop type mapping and an ideal approach should include all types of crops. You can follow the approach to create your own crop type mapping system, utilize the pipeline to fetch satellite imagery for various purposes, get inspired by the use and fine-tuning of the geospatial foundational model and apply it to a different task. You can also use the collected reference data for your own model. Accurate data on which crop grows were can be used in various applications e.g. improving agricultural policy and business decisions, integrating with yield estimation frameworks for spatially detailed predictions of seasonal production, crop health monitoring, crop insurance design, value chain assessments, supply and demand forecasting, and more.

 The data was collected over the span of 1.5 years covering different crop cycles between 2022 and 2024. The Data Collection was conducted by Alliance Bioversity & CIAT and M-Omolumisa via on-the-ground visits of the farms.

For this dataset / use case, a responsible AI Assessment was undertaken to help AI developers and project managers to identify, assess and mitigate potential harms and biases in AI.

 Application:
 The dataset/model can be used for automated cherry count or coffee ripeness assessment.","This resource can be of use to anyone interested to automate the task of manual cherry counts (the traditional approach to harvest estimation) and to estimate coffee harvest on a plot level. This is done  by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, this system is useful for anyone interested in building a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member’s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.

This use case also included the development of a business model and funding model for open source AI as a stepping stone towards financially viable operations.

The dataset provides georeferenced, annotated Sentinel-2 and Hansen imagery with clear landuse and landcover classes, groundtruth data, and standardized protocols. Users can train AI models for landuse and landcover classification, detect deforestation, validate predictions, and support restoration planning. Its high resolution, temporal coverage, and open accessibility enable accurate, scalable environmental monitoring.","The AI application analyzes historical satellite imagery gereated landuse and landcover maps (2015-2024) and predicts future landuse and land-cover change, offering simple inputs including Sentinel-2 and Hansen datasets of tree cover and outputs such as classified maps and simulations for 2025 and 2030. It identifies deforestation, farmland expansion, and urban growth patterns, supporting evidence-based land management. While highly accurate (ANN: 85.2% OA), limitations include data inconsistencies, sampling bias, and reliance on remote-sensing quality. Ethical use requires adherence to responsible-AI assessment, transparency, and proper citation. The model runs on standard GIS/AI software (QGIS, google colab, Jupyter-notebook) with no special hardware. All derived datasets and protocols are open for reuse under an open license; users must credit the original project to strengthen community knowledge and track downstream impact.","One can immediately use this AI system to classify landuse and landcover types, detect deforestation, and generate LULC predictions for 2025–2030. Users can replicate the full workflow from preprocessing imagery, training ANN models, and simulating future change scenarios to support forest monitoring, restoration planning, district land-use decision-making, or environmental reporting. Researchers can extend the work by integrating socio-economic variables, testing hybrid models, adding additional years of imagery, or adapting the model to new districts. Replication requires awareness of limitations such as sampling imbalance, image quality differences, and potential classification bias; an ethical-AI review is recommended for all downstream use. Costs remain low because the tools (QGIS, GEE, SEPAL) and datasets are free; only compute for model training (standard PCs) and technical time are required.
