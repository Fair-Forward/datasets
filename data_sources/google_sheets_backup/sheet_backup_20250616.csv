DynAG: 
 Focused on rice, wheat, and maize, DynAG's platform uses a RAG pipeline powered by LLMs like the GPT suite to provide farmers with advisory services. Accessible via chatbots, Android and Jio-based mobile apps, IVR, and SMS, it ensures wide reach. With machine translation and speech recognition, the platform supports communication in English and Hindi while utilizing CGIAR's data backbone for accurate, data-driven insights. 
  
 2. Digital Green: 
 Digital Green's platform supports agricultural value chains like dairy, coffee, and wheat in Bihar and Kenya. It integrates a RAG pipeline, using LLMs under evaluation, and offers services through an app, Telegram, and IVR. Features like machine translation, speech technology, image recognition, and weather data enable localized insights. The platform supports multiple languages, including Hindi, Swahili, Gikuyu, and Marathi, ensuring flexibility across regions. 
  
 3. Viamo and Partners: 
 This platform targets farmers in Kenya and Bihar, focusing on beans and wheat, respectively. Using IVR, SMS, and WhatsApp, the platform is built on a RAG pipeline powered by LLMs, with potential for intent and entity recognition. Machine translation and speech-enabled IVR support English, Hindi, and Swahili, making it accessible across regions. The initiative is part of a broader plan to enhance voice technology for agricultural advisory. 
 
 4. Tech for Her: 
 Tech for Her empowers women farmers in Bihar and Kenya, focusing on tomatoes and cattle. Accessible via IVR, WhatsApp, and a mobile app, the platform uses LLM-powered intent and entity recognition for personalized chatbot interactions and speech-enabled IVR for voice support.

Building parallel corpora for Kenya’s Indigenous Languages and Swahili,ui_40,Building parallel corpora for Kenya’s Indigenous Languages and Swahili,,Kenya,"This team collected parallel text corpora for three Kenyan indigenous languages, Kidaw’ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo, alongside Kiswahili, resulting in approximately 90,000 sentence pairs in total. After collection, the team separated out the Kidaw’ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo sentences and used them as monolingual datasets for crowd-sourcing speech data, facilitated by uploading the sentences to Mozilla Common Voice. A total of 109 members of the three language communities were recruited to read and record sentences from their respective native languages. Emphasizing gender balance and including different ages and regional variants helped to make the datasets more representative. The voice datasets offer a substantial amount of speech data, comprising 56 hours of Kidaw’ida, 92 hours of Kalenjin, and 120 hours of Dholuo, for a total of 268 hours.
 
 Use cases for these parallel corpora include training models to translate text between Kiswahili and Kidaw’ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo. The speech data on Mozilla Common Voice, along with its associated text data, is intended to be used for the development of speech recognition applications. The languages that comprise this dataset are low-resource, especially Kidaw’ida, which has only around 400,000 speakers and faces a more immediate risk of loss. By collecting the text and speech data, this team contributed to the preservation of these languages. They hope that once enough data has been collected to train accurate models and create NLP applications for these three languages, they will become more relevant in the modern digital age, thus mitigating the risk of loss.",https://zenodo.org/records/13355021,,Climate Action,,,Audrey Mbogho (ambogho@usiu.ac.ke),,,,"Powered by:

","The agricultural sector makes a substantial contribution to GDP and livelihoods across the developing world.

Earth observation satellites provide a wealth of multispectral image data that can be used for developing agricultural monitoring tools. These tools support farmers and policy-makers across Africa and the developing world.

 The dataset is made of a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffee tree parts (with and without a background isolation element) with individual bounding boxes around all coffee cherries. These RGB pictures were on-farm collected with smartphones with the collaboration of smallholder farmers.

 - Dataset
 - Model
 Application:
 The dataset/model can be used for automated cherry count or coffee ripeness assessment.","Instead of manual cherry counts (the traditional approach to harvest estimation), pictures of the coffee branches are used to automate this task. The coffee harvest on a plot level is estimated by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, Croppie serves as a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member’s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.","Powered by:
