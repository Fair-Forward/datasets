# Memory Log for Data Catalog Project

## 2024-11-29: Fixed Website Appearance and Functionality

### Issue
The data catalog website was being built correctly, but it was missing the card design, filter functionality, and JavaScript dynamic elements. The HTML file was successfully generated, but it lacked the proper styling and interactive features.

### Solution
1. Enhanced the `generate_catalog.py` script to include:
   - Dynamic CSS generation for different data categories
   - Proper card HTML structure matching the old design
   - Filter controls HTML (search box, dropdowns for domain, data type, etc.)
   - JavaScript code for filtering and interactive features
   - Slide-in detail panel for "How to use it" functionality

2. Added several new functions:
   - `get_unique_categories()` - Extracts unique domains, data types, statuses and regions
   - `generate_label_css()` - Creates CSS for category labels with appropriate colors
   - `generate_filter_html()` - Creates the filter control HTML
   - `generate_js_code()` - Creates the JavaScript code for interactivity
   - `generate_detail_panel_html()` - Creates the slide-in panel HTML

3. Improved the card generation process to:
   - Properly handle dataset and use case links
   - Add appropriate data attributes for filtering
   - Format domain badges and tags correctly
   - Create read-more functionality for descriptions

### Implementation
The website now has the complete functionality of the original design, including:
- Filter controls to filter by data type, domain, and region
- Search functionality to find specific datasets
- Cards with visual styling showing dataset information
- "Read more" functionality on longer descriptions
- Detail slide-in panel when clicking "How to use it"

### For running the test branch locally 
```bash
cd docs && python -m http.server 8000

## 2024-11-29: Fixed Data Catalog Generation Process

### Issue
The data catalog generation process was broken. The `generate_catalog.py` script was calling functions that were defined after they were used, and it was missing helper functions that were defined in `catalog_new.py` but not properly imported or defined in `generate_catalog.py`.

### Solution
1. Reorganized the `generate_catalog.py` file to define functions before they are used
2. Added missing helper functions from `catalog_new.py`:
   - `convert_markdown_links_to_html()`
   - `normalize_label()`
   - `create_label_html()`
3. Fixed a potential type error in the `generate_card_html()` function by ensuring the title is converted to a string before checking if 'CadiAI' is in it

### Implementation
The fixed `generate_catalog.py` file now properly generates HTML content from the Excel file data. The workflow is:
1. `build_from_google_sheets.py` fetches data from Google Sheets and saves it to an Excel file
2. `generate_catalog.py` reads the Excel file and generates the HTML website
