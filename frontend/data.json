The project was created in response to a persistent data gap in the Himalayan region where limited open data and difficult terrain have hindered effective monitoring of forest degradation and the impact of restoration programs. Using locally calibrated AI models trained on Indian biomass data, the system combines satellite observations with ground level socio-economic surveys to measure forest dependency, identify degradation hotspots and track restoration outcomes. All datasets ranging from community level livelihood surveys in Sikkim and Mizoram to forest biomass and land use layers in Assam are openly available. Together they form a replicable, open-source \u201cdigital public good\u201d that can be used to train local AI models for forest monitoring, biodiversity accounting or impact assessment. By providing a scalable, context-aware dataset, this initiative enables indigenous start-ups, environmental NGOs and impact investors to quantify nature positive outcomes, align with IRIS+ indicators, and guide conservation investments.\nThe goal is to make environmental monitoring inclusive and data driven, empowering local actors to track changes in forest carbon, identify erosion risks and measure the socio-economic benefits of restoration. Ultimately, this approach helps governments, researchers and entrepreneurs build locally adapted AI systems that support both ecosystem regeneration and sustainable livelihoods in fragile mountain regions.","Dataset Link":"https:\/\/github.com\/vertify-earth\/biomass-prediction-NorthEastIndia; https:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/16536024","Model\/Use-Case Links":"https:\/\/felt.com\/embed\/map\/Nature-Audit-on-Agapi-Sourcing-Sites-JBeP3LpnTCmabCOFb9AVrAC?loc=27.317897%2C88.595673%2C15.25z; https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WaunaB-HU-j9UDs-X5Fn1vJ15H4ENMe-lcEgWM9l3Eg\/edit?usp=sharing","Domain\/SDG":"SDG 15, SDG 13","Data Type":"Geospatial\/Remote Sensing","Point of Contact\/Communities":"Vertify.earth - Michael Anthony (michael@vertify.earth), \nAlsisar Impact - Saurabh Singhavi (saurabh@alsisarimpact.com)","Country Team":"India","Data - Key Characteristics":"This dataset integrates geospatial and socio-economic information to monitor forest restoration and livelihoods in the Eastern Himalayas.

What is this about?":"This prototype automated crop type mapping system for Rwanda leverages multi-sensor remote sensing data (Sentinel 1 & 2, dynamic world, SRTM). The crop mapping pipeline can be used to map the four most important staple foods in Rwanda (rice, maize, beans, Irish potatoes) in four Rwandan districts, and produce timely, 10-meter resolution crop type maps. Reference data from different sources including project field work, global research projects, and Rwandan authorities were used to fine-tune the geospatial foundational model Galileo for the downstream task of mapping what type of crop grows where. The reference data collected in the field was supported through the creation of polygon labels with PlanetScope imagery in collaboration with Rwandan academia. The crop mapping pipeline, the fine-tuned model, and the project's reference data are openly available for further usage. The overall good accuracy yielded by the approach under conditions with small field sizes, varying elevation and high cloud cover are promising for a successful application in all kinds of regions. Nevertheless, local reference data remains crucial for crop type mapping and an ideal approach should include all types of crops. You can follow the approach to create your own crop type mapping system, utilize the pipeline to fetch satellite imagery for various purposes, get inspired by the use and fine-tuning of the geospatial foundational model and apply it to a different task. You can also use the collected reference data for your own model. Accurate data on which crop grows were can be used in various applications e.g. improving agricultural policy and business decisions, integrating with yield estimation frameworks for spatially detailed predictions of seasonal production, crop health monitoring, crop insurance design, value chain assessments, supply and demand forecasting, and more. \n","Dataset Link":"https:\/\/dataverse.harvard.edu\/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910\/DVN\/O7IDTD","Model\/Use-Case Links":"crop-type-mapping \u00b7 GitHub","Domain\/SDG":"SDG 2","Data Type":"Geospatial\/Remote Sensing","Point of Contact\/Communities":"Benson Kenduiyvo (b.kenduiywo@cgiar.org)","Country Team":"Rwanda","Data - Key Characteristics":"","Model\/Use-Case - Key Characteristics":"","Deep Dive - How can you concretely work with this and build on this?":"","License":"MIT License","Organizations Involved":"Powered by: Alliance Bioversity International & CIAT\nCatalyzed by: FAIR Forward - AI for All\nFinanced by: BMZ","Authors":"Golo Rademacher","Lacuna Dataset":null,"Maturity \/ Readiness for replication or scaling [INTERNAL]":"Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case >  Use-Case with Business Model","Technical Domain":"Computer Vision","Expressive visualization \/ picture related to dataset \/ possible use \/ story-tellling":null,"Additional Resources (Paper, Publications, etc)":null,"Info on fair sharing as as Digital Public Good ":null,"Comments":"More details as well as link to data to be added"},{"Project ID":"ui_51","OnSite Name":"Landslide monitoring model development \u2013 data challenge\/use case development follow-up","Dataset Speaking Titles":null,"Use Case Speaking Title":"SEE ABOVE","Description - What can be done with this?

These four languages span Central and Eastern Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Northern Cameroon. The dataset can help to anonymize and pseudonymize personally identifiable information in AI tasks. This can help organizations comply with legal requirements while still being able to analyze and use and share their data effectively. It can also be used to improve machine translation systems for low-resource languages,  improve the performance of NLP applications in these languages, and support the extraction of specific information from text, such as automated form filling and information retrieval systems. It comprises 4000 Luganda sentences, 5000 Lumasaba sentences, 3000 Kanuri sentences, and 3000 Hausa sentences. The team aimed to curate a dataset that is gender inclusive.
