Existing works on underrepresented languages mostly focus on machine translation and simple language understanding tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification. More complex tasks such as open-domain dialogue and dialogue summarization, are still left behind for these underrepresented languages which leads to a poor evaluation suite for assessing the capability of large language models (LMs) in these underrepresented languages. Mitigating this limitation, we introduce NusaDialogue, the first underrepresented languages datasets consisting of manually annotated dialogue along with its summary.\n\nNusaDialogue covers 3 underrepresented languages under the Malayo-Polynesian languages group, i.e., Minangkabau (min), Balinese (ban), and Buginese (bug), each consisting of 10,000 dialogue and summary pairs.

Including these languages in summarization datasets helps bridge this gap, ensuring that digital platforms and technologies are accessible and beneficial to a broader range of linguistic communities.\n\nEncouraging Linguistic Research\n\nThe creation of NusaDialogue can stimulate interest and research in linguistics, language preservation, and computational linguistics. This can lead to a better understanding of the unique linguistic features of these languages and the development of more tailored language technologies.\n\nAddressing Bias and Fairness in NLP\n\nThrough NusaDialogue , there is an opportunity to address biases present in NLP systems that are often trained on data from dominant languages. This can contribute to the development of more fair and unbiased language technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the social impact of NusaDialogue extends beyond technology to cultural preservation, education, inclusivity, and cross-cultural understanding. It has the potential to empower communities, promote linguistic diversity, and contribute to a more equitable and interconnected global society.","License":"","Organizations Involved":"Powered by: Prosa.ai \nCatalyzed by: FAIR Forward - AI for All\nFinanced by: BMZ","Authors":"Prosa.ai \/ Balthas Seibold","Lacuna Dataset":null,"Maturity \/ Readiness for replication or scaling [INTERNAL]":"Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case","Technical Domain":"NLP","Expressive visualization \/ picture related to dataset \/ possible use \/ story-tellling":null,"Additional Resources (Paper, Publications, etc)":null,"Info on fair sharing as as Digital Public Good ":null,"Comments":null},{"Project ID":"ui_31","OnSite Name":"Blue economy for climate mitigation and climate - leveraging AI, community-based approaches and local IoT-measurements","Dataset Speaking Titles":"Blue economy for climate mitigation and climate - leveraging AI, community-based approaches and local IoT-measurements","Use Case Speaking Title":"Blue economy for climate mitigation and climate - leveraging AI, community-based approaches and local IoT-measurements","Description - What can be done with this?

However, regular and reliable agricultural data remains difficult and expensive to collect on the ground. As a result, policy-makers usually don\u2019t have access to updated data for implementing policies or supporting farmers. Earth observation satellites provide a wealth of multispectral image data that can be used for developing agricultural monitoring tools. These tools support farmers and policy-makers across Africa and the developing world.

The coffee harvest on a plot level is estimated by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, Croppie serves as a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member\u2019s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.","License":"","Organizations Involved":"Powered by:  \nCatalyzed by: FAIR Forward - AI for All\nFinanced by: BMZ","Authors":null,"Lacuna Dataset":null,"Maturity \/ Readiness for replication or scaling [INTERNAL]":"Dataset  > Model > Pilot > Use-Case >  Use-Case with Business Model","Technical Domain":"Computer Vision","Expressive visualization \/ picture related to dataset \/ possible use \/ story-tellling":null,"Additional Resources (Paper, Publications, etc)":null,"Info on fair sharing as as Digital Public Good ":null,"Comments":"Alternative title: Precision Farming Simplified: Croppie\u2019s AI-Powered Agronomic Advisor"},{"Project ID":"ui_56","OnSite Name":"Scaling ML-based site identification for MiniGrids Uganda","Dataset Speaking Titles":"Bridging the Energy Gap: Machine Learning Applications in Uganda's Rural Electrification","Use Case Speaking Title":"Finding good spots for decentralized green energy grids in Uganda I - AI based site identification for MiniGrids","Description - What can be done with this?
