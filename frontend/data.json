The initiative aims to build a multilingual disinformation detection system, covering Bahasa Indonesia and over 10,6 million words and 21 million words translation from Minangkabau, Balinese, and Buginese to classify and verify climate-related content. The application supports stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and communities, in countering false narratives, promoting awareness, and enabling evidence-based decision-making. The AI outcomes include open-access datasets, disinformation, and topic classification models, a user-friendly website, and a chatbot. These tools empower users to identify climate misinformation, enhance public literacy, and foster collaboration for sustainable climate actions. The project emphasizes inclusivity, accessibility, and long-term impact, providing resources for researchers, local businesses, and policy-makers to advance AI applications in combating misinformation. Prosa has developed an AI-powered chatbot to address climate misinformation. The platform's website is available at faktaiklim.prosa.ai, and the chatbot can be accessed via Telegram (Fakta Iklim Bot), with open-source code available on GitHub.
