What is this about?":"This team collected parallel text corpora for three Kenyan indigenous languages, Kidaw\u2019ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo, alongside Kiswahili, resulting in approximately 90,000 sentence pairs in total. After collection, the team separated out the Kidaw\u2019ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo sentences and used them as monolingual datasets for crowd-sourcing speech data, facilitated by uploading the sentences to Mozilla Common Voice. A total of 109 members of the three language communities were recruited to read and record sentences from their respective native languages. Emphasizing gender balance and including different ages and regional variants helped to make the datasets more representative. The voice datasets offer a substantial amount of speech data, comprising 56 hours of Kidaw\u2019ida, 92 hours of Kalenjin, and 120 hours of Dholuo, for a total of 268 hours.\n \n Use cases for these parallel corpora include training models to translate text between Kiswahili and Kidaw\u2019ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo. The speech data on Mozilla Common Voice, along with its associated text data, is intended to be used for the development of speech recognition applications. The languages that comprise this dataset are low-resource, especially Kidaw\u2019ida, which has only around 400,000 speakers and faces a more immediate risk of loss. By collecting the text and speech data, this team contributed to the preservation of these languages. They hope that once enough data has been collected to train accurate models and create NLP applications for these three languages, they will become more relevant in the modern digital age, thus mitigating the risk of loss.","Dataset Link":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/13355021","Model\/Use-Case Links":null,"Domain\/SDG":"Climate Action","Use Case Pipeline Status":null,"Data Type":"","Point of Contact\/Communities":"Audrey Mbogho (ambogho@usiu.ac.ke)","Country Team":"Kenya","Data - Key Characteristics":"","Model\/Use-Case - Key Characteristics":"","Deep Dive - How can you concretely work with this and build on this?":"","License":"","Organizations Involved":"Powered by:  \nCatalyzed by: Lacuna-Fund \/ Meridian & FAIR Forward - AI for All\nFinanced by: BMZ","Authors":null,"Technical Domain":null,"Expressive visualization \/ picture related to dataset \/ possible use \/ story-tellling":null,"Additional Resources (Paper, Publications, etc)":null,"Unnamed: 21":null,"Info on fair sharing as as Digital Public Good ":null},{"Project ID":"ui_41","OnSite Name":"Labelled Open solar panel data for Madagascar","Dataset Speaking Titles":"Labelled Open solar panel data for Madagascar","Use Case Speaking Title":null,"Description - What can be done with this?

The coffee harvest on a plot level is estimated by processing pictures through AI-supported image recognition software along with a manual branch count (= tree level estimation) and a tree-per-ha estimation (or recall data) (scaling to plot level). Thus, Croppie serves as a central system for managing yield data at the farmer level. It also provides the option to share this data with external users; with for example cooperatives having the possibility to feed information from the application in an integrated database of their member\u2019s performance and farm characteristics, provided they obtained prior consent to do so. This would then scale the Croppie system to have an aggregated data view of multiple users in a region, e.g. as a cooperative level dashboard.","License":"","Organizations Involved":"Powered by:  \nCatalyzed by: FAIR Forward - AI for All\nFinanced by: BMZ","Authors":null,"Technical Domain":"Computer Vision","Expressive visualization \/ picture related to dataset \/ possible use \/ story-tellling":null,"Additional Resources (Paper, Publications, etc)":null,"Unnamed: 21":null,"Info on fair sharing as as Digital Public Good ":null},{"Project ID":"ui_56","OnSite Name":"Scaling ML-based site identification for MiniGrids Uganda","Dataset Speaking Titles":"Bridging the Energy Gap: Machine Learning Applications in Uganda's Rural Electrification","Use Case Speaking Title":"Finding good spots for decentralized green energy grids in Uganda I - AI based site identification for MiniGrids","Description - What can be done with this?
