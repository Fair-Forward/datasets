# Data Catalog

Welcome to our organization's data catalog. Below is a list of datasets that have been collected throughout our programme Fair Forward.

You can access the catalog here: [Data Catalog!](https://fair-forward.github.io/datasets/)

> **Note:** This data catalog is currently a prototype and is not yet fully developed. It is intended to showcase the concept and functionality, but may undergo significant changes in the future.

## Development

This repository contains the code for generating a static website that displays a catalog of datasets and use cases. The website is built from data stored in an Excel file or fetched from a Google Spreadsheet. The repository includes both a static HTML generator and a React frontend.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages for main functionality: `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `gspread`, `oauth2client`
- Required packages for placeholder images: `requests`, `python-dotenv`
- Node.js and npm (for React frontend)

You can install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl gspread oauth2client
pip install -r placeholder_images_requirements.txt
```

### Building the Website

#### From Local Excel File

To build the website from the local Excel file:

```bash
python generate_catalog.py
```

This will read the data from `docs/data_catalog.xlsx` and generate the website in `docs/index.html`. It will also export the data as JSON for the React frontend to `frontend/data.json`.

#### From Google Spreadsheet

To fetch data from Google Spreadsheet and build the website:

```bash
python build_from_google_sheets.py
```

This will:
1. Fetch data from the Google Spreadsheet
2. Save it to `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`
3. Build the website from the Excel file

### Placeholder Images

The repository includes a script to automatically download placeholder images for projects that don't have images yet:

```bash
python download_placeholder_images.py
```

This script:
- Scans all project directories in the data catalog
- Extracts relevant keywords from project metadata
- Searches for images using the Pexels API
- Downloads images and saves them with a "placeholder_" prefix
- Creates metadata files with attribution information

You need a Pexels API key to use this feature. You can set it up in two ways:
- Create a `.env` file with `PEXELS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- Pass the API key as a command-line argument: `python download_placeholder_images.py --api-key YOUR_API_KEY`

For more details, see [placeholder_images_README.md](placeholder_images_README.md).

### React Frontend

The repository also includes a React frontend in the `frontend/` directory. To run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The React app uses the data from `frontend/data.json`, which is generated by the `generate_catalog.py` script.

### Configuration

#### Google Sheets API Credentials

To use the Google Sheets API, you need to set up credentials:

1. Create a service account in the Google Cloud Console
2. Download the JSON key file
3. Save it as `data_sources/google_sheets_api/service_account.json`

#### Command Line Arguments

The `generate_catalog.py` script accepts the following arguments:

- `--input`: Path to the input Excel file (default: `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`)
- `--output`: Path to the output HTML file (default: `docs/index.html`)

The `build_from_google_sheets.py` script accepts the following arguments:

- `--output`: Path to save the Excel file (default: `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`)
- `--credentials`: Path to the Google Sheets API credentials file (default: `data_sources/google_sheets_api/service_account_JN.json`)
- `--backup`: Create a backup of the existing Excel file
- `--skip-fetch`: Skip fetching data from Google Sheets and just build the website

The `download_placeholder_images.py` script accepts these arguments:

- `--api-key`: Pexels API key (can also be set in `.env` file)
- `--limit`: Maximum number of projects to process
- `--force`: Force download even if images already exist
- `--min-width`: Minimum image width
- `--min-height`: Minimum image height
- `--data-file`: Path to data catalog Excel file

### Project Structure

- `generate_catalog.py`: Main script for generating the HTML catalog from Excel data
- `build_from_google_sheets.py`: Script for fetching data from Google Sheets and building the website
- `download_placeholder_images.py`: Script for downloading placeholder images for projects
- `placeholder_images_README.md`: Documentation for the placeholder image feature
- `docs/`: Directory containing the generated website and assets
  - `data_catalog.xlsx`: Excel file containing the dataset information
  - `index.html`: Generated HTML file for the website
  - `enhanced_side_panel.js` and `enhanced_side_panel.css`: Styling and functionality for the side panel
  - `public/projects/`: Directory containing project-specific data and images
- `frontend/`: Directory containing the React frontend
  - `src/`: React source code
  - `data.json`: Data exported from the Excel file for the React app
- `data_sources/`: Directory containing scripts and credentials for data sources

### GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the website:

- `.github/workflows/update_markdown.yml`: Builds the website from the local Excel file when changes are pushed
- `.github/workflows/update_from_google_sheets.yml`: Fetches data from Google Sheets and builds the website on a schedule

### Features

The data catalog includes the following features:

- Modern UI with a clean, responsive layout
- Filtering by domain, data type, and region
- Search functionality for finding specific datasets or use cases
- Visual distinction between domains and data types
- Detailed information for each dataset and use case
- Links to external resources for datasets and use cases
- Enhanced side panel for displaying detailed project information
- Automatic placeholder images for projects without custom images
- React frontend for a more interactive user experience
