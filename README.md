# Data Catalog

Welcome to our organization's data and use-case catalog. Below is a list of datasets and use-cases that have been collected throughout our programme Fair Forward. 

You can access the live website here: [Data Catalog!](https://fair-forward.github.io/datasets/)

> **Note:** This data catalog is currently a prototype and is not yet fully developed. It is intended to showcase the concept and functionality, but may undergo significant changes in the future.

## How to Contribute Data

Want to add your dataset or AI use case to this catalog? Great!

1.  **Access the Source:** The data for this catalog lives in this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18sgZgPGZuZjeBTHrmbr1Ra7mx8vSToUqnx8vCjhIp0c/edit?gid=561894456#gid=561894456).
2.  **Add Your Project:** Add a new row to the sheet and fill in the details for your project. Please follow the format of existing entries and use the second row as a guide for the expected content in each column.
3.  **Update the Website:** Once you've added your information to the Google Sheet, the website needs to be rebuilt to include it. Please contact one of the repository maintainers or follow the "Update via GitHub Actions" steps below (if you have write access) to trigger an update.

## How to Update the Catalog

The content of this catalog is primarily sourced from the Google Sheet mentioned above. Changes made there need to be reflected on the website.

There are two main ways to update the website:

1.  **Local Update (for Developers):**
    *   Ensure you have the prerequisites installed (see Development section).
    *   Run the main build script locally: `python build_from_google_sheets.py`
    *   This single script fetches the latest data, applies necessary processing (like fuzzy column matching), saves the intermediate `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`, creates/updates project markdown files in `docs/public/projects/`, generates the final `docs/index.html`, and saves a daily backup CSV to `data_sources/google_sheets_backup/`.
    *   Optionally, run `python download_placeholder_images.py` if new projects need placeholder images (requires Pexels API key setup).
    *   Commit and push all changed files (including `index.html`, `.xlsx`, backups, and any new/modified files in `docs/public/projects/`) to the `main` branch.

2.  **Update via GitHub Actions (for Non-Developers with Repo Access):**
    *   This method allows updating the website directly from GitHub without running code locally.
    *   Go to the repository's **Actions** tab on GitHub.
    *   In the left sidebar, click on the "**Manually Update Website from Google Sheets**" workflow.
    *   Above the list of workflow runs, click the "**Run workflow**" dropdown button.
    *   Ensure the "Branch: `main`" is selected.
    *   Click the green "**Run workflow**" button.
    *   The workflow will perform the same steps as running `build_from_google_sheets.py` locally, fetching the latest data, rebuilding the website, and automatically committing the changes to the `main` branch. The live website will be updated shortly after the workflow completes successfully. (Note: This action does not currently run the placeholder image download script).

## Development

This repository contains the code for generating a static website data catalog.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (due to `thefuzz` dependency)
- Required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Node.js and npm (Optional: only needed for the React frontend development)

Install Python packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building the Website Locally

The primary script handles fetching data and building the site:
```bash
python build_from_google_sheets.py
```
This script:
1. Fetches data from the Google Spreadsheet.
2. Performs fuzzy matching on column headers.
3. Saves the processed data to `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`.
4. Creates/updates markdown documentation files in `docs/public/projects/*/docs/`.
5. Creates/updates project image folders in `docs/public/projects/*/images/`.
6. Saves a daily raw backup to `data_sources/google_sheets_backup/`.
7. Runs `generate_catalog.py` internally to build `docs/index.html`.

If you only want to regenerate the HTML from the existing `docs/data_catalog.xlsx` without fetching from Google Sheets, you can run:
```bash
python generate_catalog.py
```

### Placeholder Images

To download placeholder images for projects lacking them:
```bash
python download_placeholder_images.py
```
This requires a Pexels API key. Set it up via:
- A `.env` file in the root directory: `PEXELS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- Command-line argument: `--api-key YOUR_API_KEY`

(Note: The `download_placeholder_images.py` script uses `requirements.txt` for its dependencies.)

### React Frontend (Experimental)

The `frontend/` directory contains an experimental React frontend. It uses data from `frontend/data.json`, generated by `generate_catalog.py`.

To run:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

#### Google Sheets API Credentials

1. Create a Google Cloud service account.
2. Download its JSON key file.
3. Save it as `data_sources/google_sheets_api/service_account_JN.json` (or match the path used in scripts/workflows).
4. Ensure this file is listed in `.gitignore` and **never commit it**.

#### Pexels API Key

Needed for `download_placeholder_images.py`. Set via `.env` file or `--api-key` argument.

### Project Structure

- `build_from_google_sheets.py`: Main script for fetching data from Google Sheets and orchestrating the website build.
- `generate_catalog.py`: Generates the HTML catalog (`docs/index.html`) from `docs/data_catalog.xlsx`.
- `download_placeholder_images.py`: Downloads placeholder images for projects.
- `backup_google_sheet.py`: Standalone script for monthly raw data backup (used by GitHub Action).
- `requirements.txt`: Consolidated Python dependencies for the build process.
- `docs/`: Directory containing the generated website and assets.
  - `data_catalog.xlsx`: Intermediate Excel file processed from Google Sheet.
  - `index.html`: Generated HTML file for the website (served by GitHub Pages).
  - `enhanced_side_panel.js` and `enhanced_side_panel.css`: Side panel functionality.
  - `public/projects/`: Project-specific markdown files and images.
- `frontend/`: (Experimental) React frontend.
- `data_sources/`: Credentials and backups.
  - `google_sheets_api/`: Credentials file (ignored by git).
  - `google_sheets_backup/`: Daily and monthly raw CSV backups (tracked by git).
- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflow files.

### GitHub Actions

- `.github/workflows/update_from_google_sheets.yml`: **Manually triggered** workflow to run `build_from_google_sheets.py` and commit results to `main`.
- `.github/workflows/monthly_backup.yml`: **Automatically triggered** workflow (1st of month) to run `backup_google_sheet.py` and commit the monthly raw CSV backup.

### Features

- Modern UI with a clean, responsive layout
- Filtering by domain, data type, and region
- Search functionality for finding specific datasets or use cases
- Visual distinction between domains and data types
- Detailed information for each dataset and use case
- Links to external resources for datasets and use cases
- Enhanced side panel for displaying detailed project information
- Automatic placeholder images for projects without custom images
- React frontend for a more interactive user experience
