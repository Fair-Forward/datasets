## What this is about and how can I use this?

This AI application and replication kit focuses on an AI-based crop type map for Telangana. It supports sustainable farming practices and evidence-based agricultural decision-making. The dataset can empower local businesses, NGOs, and government agencies to develop digital agricultural applications.

Key components include:
- **Localized Ground-Truth Data**: Variables such as crop types, health, and yield.
- **Open Access**: Data, models, crop maps, and a replication kit are freely available as open-source.
- **Applications**: Roadmaps for AI implementation in agriculture, yield prediction models, and crop classification using satellite imagery.

## Deep Dive: How can you concretely work with this and build on this?

- Use existing models for yield prediction and crop type mapping to infer data for neighboring regions.
- Combine the dataset with other open-source datasets from ADEX for research or commercial purposes.
- Leverage unique features (e.g., irrigation methods, crop health, expected yield) to build advanced crop monitoring/recommendation systems.
- Benchmark different crop datasets/models or inform geospatial models.
- Collaborate with local partners like the Telangana Government, NABARD, and IT/Agriculture departments.
