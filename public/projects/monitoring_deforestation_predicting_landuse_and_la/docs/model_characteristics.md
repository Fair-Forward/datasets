The AI application analyzes historical satellite imagery gereated landuse and landcover maps (2015-2024) and predicts future landuse and land-cover change, offering simple inputs including Sentinel-2 and Hansen datasets of tree cover and outputs such as classified maps and simulations for 2025 and 2030. It identifies deforestation, farmland expansion, and urban growth patterns, supporting evidence-based land management. While highly accurate (ANN: 85.2% OA), limitations include data inconsistencies, sampling bias, and reliance on remote-sensing quality. Ethical use requires adherence to responsible-AI assessment, transparency, and proper citation. The model runs on standard GIS/AI software (QGIS, google colab, Jupyter-notebook) with no special hardware. All derived datasets and protocols are open for reuse under an open license; users must credit the original project to strengthen community knowledge and track downstream impact.
