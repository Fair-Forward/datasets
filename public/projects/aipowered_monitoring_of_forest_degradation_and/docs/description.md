An AI-Driven Dataset for Nature-Positive Livelihoods and Forest Restoration in Eastern Himalayas.This open-access dataset and digital MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) toolkit was  developed to help communities, NGOs and policymakers in the Eastern Himalayas measure and manage the links between forests, livelihoods and climate resilience. The project was created in response to a persistent data gap in the Himalayan region where limited open data and difficult terrain have hindered effective monitoring of forest degradation and the impact of restoration programs. Using locally calibrated AI models trained on Indian biomass data, the system combines satellite observations with ground level socio-economic surveys to measure forest dependency, identify degradation hotspots and track restoration outcomes. All datasets ranging from community level livelihood surveys in Sikkim and Mizoram to forest biomass and land use layers in Assam are openly available. Together they form a replicable, open-source “digital public good” that can be used to train local AI models for forest monitoring, biodiversity accounting or impact assessment. By providing a scalable, context-aware dataset, this initiative enables indigenous start-ups, environmental NGOs and impact investors to quantify nature positive outcomes, align with IRIS+ indicators, and guide conservation investments.
The goal is to make environmental monitoring inclusive and data driven, empowering local actors to track changes in forest carbon, identify erosion risks and measure the socio-economic benefits of restoration. Ultimately, this approach helps governments, researchers and entrepreneurs build locally adapted AI systems that support both ecosystem regeneration and sustainable livelihoods in fragile mountain regions.
