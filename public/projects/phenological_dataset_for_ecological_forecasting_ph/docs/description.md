The health of tropical forest ecosystems faces pressures from climate change, threatening the sustainable supply of leaves, flowers and fruits which provide important resources for wildlife, domestic animals and human settlements. Monitoring the timing of plant life cycle events (phenology) is one effective way to track the availability of plant resources and the impact of climate change and weather variability on their sustainable supply. This dataset is on 48 weeks of liana and tree phenology from ground observations, traditonal ecological knowedge and camera traps in the canopy in two tropical forest ecosystems (a moist semi-deciduous and a dry semi-deciduous forest). The dataset also includes land surface phenology from satellite images and in situ weather data. Phenology data from multiple sources and climate data could be combined via a machine learning model that can be used to predict phenology at community and landscape scales. This data will enhance the representation of tropical African forests in phenology research and contribute meaningful data from tropical African forests for machine learning applications in climate, forests and biodiversity conservation. The images and phenology labels could also be used to train an automation of identifying phenology events in forest canopy images.
