Together with Smart Africa, FAIR Forward supported seven startups through intensive technical and business support to develop their AI businesses focused on mitigating and adapting to climate change in four countries through the Innovate Africa Challenge format in its first iteration focusing on AI for Climate Action. 
The winner IMARIKA by Strathmore University’s iLabAfrica - chosen for its potential to advance climate adaptation for small-holder farmer communities - builds low-cost automatic weather station networks to provide access to accurate, local weather information in rural Kenya. This granular data allows advisory services for small-holder farmers to shift from using generic information to location-specific guidance, delivered through farmer organizations and digital platforms. IMARIKA also works on translating weather data into actionable recommendations, addressing farmers’ difficulty in interpreting weather information.
For anyone interested in translating weather information into actionable advisory for farming practices, Imarika's Agricultural AI Assistant which is an intelligent agricultural advisory system powered by LangGraph, Knowledge Graph, and Ollama models specialized in 6 East African crops with multilingual support (English/Swahili) is worth looking into. 
Anyone running several weather stations with a need to process the data may be interested in Imarika's real-time weather data processing pipeline built with Apache Spark, Kafka, and PostgreSQL.
