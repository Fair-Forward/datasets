This dataset and AI model can be used immediately for forest monitoring, restoration planning and impact measurement in mountain and forested regions. Users can map biomass, detect forest loss or assess community-level livelihood impacts by combining the open dataset with freely available satellite imagery. NGOs, research institutions, investors can directly apply the dataset to design or evaluate nature positive projects, while developers can integrate the AI model into their own MRV dashboards. Researchers and AI developers can extend this work by retraining the biomass model with local field data from other regions or adding new layers such as soil moisture or biodiversity indicators. Ethical replication should include community consent and data validation steps to ensure fair and context aware use.
