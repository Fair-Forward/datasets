In Uganda, the Civil Society and Budget Advocacy Group (CSBAG) in partnership with GIZ, has recognized the need for further enhancement in how audit reports are processed and understood. An AI-powered conversational assistant was designed to help anyone understand audit reports. It will answer questions by using Audit reports published by Auditor General Office, Uganda. The prototype tool leverages AI to offer capabilities such as summarizing complex texts, extracting thematic insights, and enabling interactive, user-friendly analysis through a chatbot interface. By making the audit reports more accessible, this aims to increase readership and utilization among stakeholders, which can lead to better accountability and improve service delivery.
