The Ltome-Katip datasets are the first Indigenous-labelled bioacoustic datasets designed specifically to support the development of ethical AI for biodiversity monitoring. Co-created by Indigenous data stewards from the Samburu tribe in northern Kenya and the Shuar Nation in the Ecuadorian Amazon, the recordings focus on two sentinel species: Ltome (elephant) and Katip (rodent), both of which signal ecological shifts under climate stress. All data were collected, annotated, and governed by the Indigenous communities, following locally defined protocols rooted in Indigenous data sovereignty. These datasets are not only scientifically valuable — they establish a precedent for how Indigenous communities can lead in setting standards for responsible, consent-based AI development.
