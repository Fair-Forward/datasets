This work can be used by anyone interested to build a conversational chatbot in English and Kinyarwanda that needs to provide key information during disease outbreaks such as checking outbreak statistics, showing some prevention tips, checking testing centers, vaccination information etc.

This use case also included the development of a business model and funding model for open source AI  as a stepping stone towards financially viable operations. It was facilitated by Villgro Africa's and FAIR Forward's  six-month mentorship programme on "Creating sustainable business and funding models with open source AI".
