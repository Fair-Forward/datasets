The EWS provides a comprehensive platform that combines AI-powered crop monitoring with localized advisory services. Organizations can access the data and models through :A self-serve platform and API for accessing predictions and analytics; Mobile applications for farmers to receive personalized crop management recommendations in local language; Integration possibilities with existing agricultural extension services and Analytics dashboards for value chain stakeholders and policy institutions. The system can be scaled to new regions and crops through transfer learning and the modular architecture allowing for continuous improvement of individual components. The platform supports both individual farmer-level insights and aggregated regional analytics to optimize crop yields and manage stressors effectively, making it valuable for various stakeholders across the agricultural sector.
This use case is also linked to the development of a business model / funding model for open source AI as a stepping stone towards financially viable operations. It was part of Villgro Africa's and "FAIR Forward — AI for All"'s  six-month mentorship programme on "Creating sustainable business and funding models with open source AI".
