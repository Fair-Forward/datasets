In Rwanda, many farmers struggle to access timely, personalized agricultural information. Traditional channels—like radio, TV, and online sources—offer limited reach and interactivity, while extension services and a national call center, staffed by only two agents for over two million farmers, face capacity constraints. To address these gaps, C4IR Rwanda, with support from GIZ Fair Forward (funder) and KiNLP (technology partner), developed a 24/7 AI-enabled Interactive Voice Response (IVR) tool for the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. Accessible via a Kinyarwanda-speaking hotline, this tool will provide critical support such as pest and disease diagnosis, agro-climatic advisories, and updates on MINAGRI’s programs, including crop insurance and climate-resilient practices. By utilizing AI and IVR technology, this project will make agricultural advisories more accessible, timely, and responsive to farmers’ needs.
